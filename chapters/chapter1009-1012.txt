Chapter 1009:


Chapter 1024 – Going Up a Mountain


Two hours ago, everyone believed that Ye Qingyu had gone mad.

Now, they felt that it must have been themselves who had gone mad.

Otherwise, they would not have seen such a sight before their eyes.

Nearly ten thousand Saint experts had been killed just like fallen leaves being swept away by a cool breeze. Eight thousand of them were instantly pulverized before dispersing among the world without leaving a single trace, while for the other two thousand, their corpses and bones remained and their blood flowed, only to be tread on by Ye Qingyu and become stepping stones for his divine battle techniques.

“This… impossible...” The old demon who had predicted that Ye Qingyu was certain to die was scared senseless at present. He had been hit so hard that he had become muddled. The scene and outcome had flipped his cognition completely upside down.

The other one-hundred-thousand-plus experts were also in a dazed state in which they were doubtful of life.

At present, their postures and manners when looking at Ye Qingyu were of admiration. None of them doubted that he could turn around and kill every one of them if he wanted. This was because he had slain the ten thousand surrendered experts with utmost ease, such that he remained in perfect condition after killing the last of them.

This was not a pyrrhic victory.

It was a massacre.

A one-sided massacre.

Even those experts who suspected that Ye Qingyu had mastered some secret techniques for protracted battles did not dare to betray a hint of their covetous thoughts. Instead, they firmly restrained their inner malice. Given that they had not dared to revolt against the Quasi-emperor’s threat and a dozen or so petty officials, they certainly all the more did not dare to show the least bit of disrespect to a bloodthirsty Ye Qingyu.

After all, in the estimation of these one hundred thousand experts, Ye Qingyu was currently already not too far off from a Quasi-emperor.

This was prestige he had killed his way to.

This was status he had killed his way to.

As long as he did not perish in the large battle on Capital Sky Peak, he would definitely become a killing god dreaded by all races of the Vast Thousand Domains, while those super large forces would almost certainly no longer dare to fight him head-on. Perhaps, only those forces which were backed up by a Quasi-emperor would have a bit of confidence when facing him.

Accompanying that would be a huge rise in the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s status.

If the process of today’s battle was publicized, there would probably no longer be any being, race, or force among the Vast Thousand Domains which would dare to bear malice against the Heaven Wasteland Empire. Unless water had entered their brains and they were tired of living that was.

“Hahahaha...” The fatty Li Shengyan laughed so much that tears nearly fell from his eyes.

He simply laughed thunderously without saying a word.

As for Tan Tianzi, Orchid Saintess, Zhang Wudao, Tao Jieqian, and the other Human race experts who were upright, they were already so excited that they could not even laugh while their bodies trembled uncontrollably. Affected by tremendous shock, ecstasy, and incredulity, they seemed to have lost the ability to express their own emotions. A Great Saint like Situ Kongming was even pinching his own face like a fool, hoping to use this most primitive method to confirm that he was not dreaming.

As for the other dozens of Human Race experts represented by the Thousand Illusions Elder, they were so regretful that their guts were churning.

They did not stand on Ye Qingyu's side earlier and did not declare their position like Tan Tianzi and the others did, and thus it was impossible for them to attach themselves to Ye Qingyu now. In particular, the Thousand Illusions Elder felt like dying and regretted his past actions whenever he recalled the small conflict he had with Ye Qingyu on the Sky River beach and the Netherworld Ferryboat.

Under the watch of countless pairs of eyes, Ye Qingyu slowly turned around.

“Avenge whatever grievances you may have. How are you all still able to hold back?”

He bared his spotlessly white teeth as he smiled.

This smile made him look as warm and friendly as the boy next door. There was not a trace of evil qi anywhere on his body, making it impossible to associate this elegant child-resembling youth with the demon who had just massacred nearly ten thousand Saint experts. This feeling of visual and psychological astoundment caused everyone to suspect once more that this was just a dream.

Orchid Saintess was the first person to come to her senses.

With a flash of her figure, she turned into a beam of flowing light and instantly arrived beside the young petty official.

“You… What are you doing?” The latter was taken aback and immediately sensed that things were no good. Appearing fierce while timid inside, he said, “How dare you… how dare. The Quasi-emperor of my sect is up on the peak. If you dare to harm me, I’ll tell him to kill your entire family. You...”

Before he had finished speaking, Orchid Saintess gave a slap.

Clap!

A resounding slap on the face left a distinct slap mark.

Given that Orchid Saintess was a Saint while the young petty official was merely at the pinnacle Immortal Step realm, there was no chance for the latter to evade this blow. Half of his face collapsed at once, while his cheekbone was pulverized. At present, his face was too horrible to be looked at, smacking of a fully ripe peach of which half had been trampled upon.

“You...” The young petty official roared angrily.

“This slap is to teach you to keep your mouth clean in the future.” With that, she issued another slap and broke the other half of his face, practically causing a portion of his head to turn into slime. Although his blood and flesh could regrow, this kind of pain caused him to go mad.

“If the Quasi-emperor of your sect is here, then kill me. Otherwise, I shall kill you.” Being a heroine, she had already completely dropped her scruples and firmed her will. Using her Saint methods, she shattered his bones inch after inch.

Subjected to immense pain, the young petty official screamed agonizingly.

The reason why Orchid Saintess was deliberately torturing him instead of killing him straight away was that she absolutely abhorred how vile he was, such that her clean and pure self was nearly ruined in the hands of this filthy person.

So frightened that their faces turned ashen pale, the other petty officials of the Four Stars Sect turned and intended to flee…

“Where are you all going?” With her murderous spirit diffusing, Tan Tianzi intercepted these officials who had borrowed the Quasi-emperor’s power to act as bullies.

“Nonono… It’s a misunderstanding, Saintess Tan Tianzi. Seeing as we’re from the same race, please let us off.”

“Indeed, we were merely obeying orders.”

Panicking, the petty officials were about to kneel on the ground and beg for mercy.

“Are you thinking about running away, you fake bullies? Too late, did you consider that we’re from the same race when you were humiliating us?” Tan Tianzi’s heart had also hardened, and she did not consider anything else. The only way for her to vent was to kill, and so she swiftly took action.

Putt-putt-putt!

Among spattering streaks of fresh blood, the heads of the petty officials shot into the sky.

A woman’s wrath was indeed frightening.

When the Thousand Illusions Elder saw this scene, he said while trembling with fear, “You all… actually killed… This is huge trouble, what are you all doing? It’s enough to just win, why did you have to kill them?”

Zhang Wudao, Tao Jieqian, and the others looked disdainfully at the Thousand Illusions Elder.

Ye Qingyu laughed.

If this person was not a human, he would probably have been killed four or five times already.

In little time, Tan Tianzi, Zhang Wudao, and the others killed off all of the petty officials and disciples of the Four Stars Sect who had remained at the entrance of the mountain path. Since they had already acted completely unashamedly, there was no longer a need for any forbearance. Even if they had spared these people, the Four Stars Sect would probably not let them off.

Being a righteous character and a female, Orchid Saintess eventually did not torture the young petty official too much before killing him.

In this way, the petty officials, who were essentially executioners with malicious intentions and hands full of blood, tasted their own medicine.

Even the other experts from various races could not help cheering inwardly and feeling relieved when they saw the vicious young petty official being killed. Earlier on, the latter’s arrogant and overbearing way of talking and doing things had pissed them off terribly. However, as good as they felt inwardly at present, they did not reveal their feelings on their faces.

The reason why Tan Tianzi, Orchid Saintess, Zhang Wudao and the others could vent, curse, and swiftly kill off those petty officials and disciples of the Four Stars Sect was that they had a common friend whose name was Ye Qingyu.

Even if the Quasi-emperor on the mountaintop was enraged by these humans, there would be this fiendgod-like youth, who could kill ten thousand Saints as soon as he unsheathed his sword in anger, providing protection for them. The experts from foreign races, however, did not have someone like that to rely on.

Therefore, they dared not reveal a trace of emotion.

However, even they had not realized that they had subconsciously began to perceive Ye Qingyu as a Quasi-emperor-level being.

“I want to go up the mountain.”

After adjusting his breath for a moment, Ye Qingyu recovered from the feeling of weakness after withdrawing from the [Ninth Limit] state of the [Limitless Divine Way], and once more relived the profound feeling of the [Ninth Limit] state for a few moments. As he gazed at the Capital Sky Peak high up in the clouds, the expression in his eyes gradually became firm.

During the earlier battle, there was a vague feeling of divine providence when his battle will reached its peak state. In that momentary splendor, he clearly felt that there were three indescribably terrifying forces locked in a delicate stalemate on Capital Sky Peak. The one which came with a familiar feeling was probably [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], and he was clearly in a disadvantageous position. One of the other two forces was also very familiar, and should be Quasi-emperor Mushan. Conversely, the other force was extremely unfamiliar yet similarly terrifying, and should probably be the Four Stars Quasi-emperor.

These three forces were entangled with one another.

The force which represented Li Xiaofei was apparently being jointly suppressed by the other two forces. Like a small dinghy on a stormy ocean, it seemed as though it could be annihilated at any time, yet it perpetually resisted and refused to retreat even an inch. This caused the Capital Sky Peak to be in a delicate state with absolutely no fluctuation of force. Perhaps this was also why the Capital Sky Peak had not been destroyed.

“Let’s go too.”

“That’s right. Rather than waiting here, we might as well go up the mountain and battle.”

“Deputy Ye Qingyu, allow us to follow you. There is no longer any turning back for us.”

Tan Tianzi, Zhang Wudao, and the others openly stated their positions.

After killing the people of the Four Stars Sect, they completely stood in Ye Qingyu's camp and did not have any way of turning back.

As for the fatty Li Shengyan, being the bloodline descendant of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] after all, it was needless to say that he definitely would follow Ye Qingyu up the mountain.

After some thinking, Ye Qingyu nodded, “Alright, let’s go up the mountain and fight together.”

Chapter 1010:


Chapter 1025 – Snow Man


The group of them turned around and headed up the mountain path with Ye Qingyu as their leader.

Tens of thousands of foreign-race experts stood behind them, and a few of them suddenly felt like scaling the mountain along with Ye Qingyu, but ultimately, no one made a move.

If they chose to follow Ye Qingyu, they would be going against the wishes of the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect, and even an idiot could predict what the consequences of defying a Quasi-emperor would be. Thus, even though several foreign-race experts had the urge to follow Ye Qingyu after witnessing his killing feats, that still was not enough for them to defy a Quasi-emperor.

Their cultivation had increased and they had gotten stronger and more respected, but their youthful impulses seemed to have left them. As they navigated political battles and formed alliances with others who were more powerful than they were, the worldly affairs unfurled like a net around them and trapped them within. The more they struggled, the tighter the net became.

Ye Qingyu did not seem to show any indication of instigating these people to follow him up the mountain.

After he walked out of the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he had weathered all kinds of difficulties, so he was extremely familiar with how the foreign races of the Vast Thousand Domains functioned—they tended to only mind their own business and would not meddle in the business of others. It would be absolutely impossible for him to get these foreign-race experts to join forces with him. Furthermore, even if he brought all these people with him up to the mountain peak, it would be difficult to predict whose side they would choose to take at the crucial moment.

If they decided to help the Four Stars Sect, who already had the upper hand, then wouldn't he be creating more trouble for himself?

The mountain paths were curvy and winding.

Ye Qingyu and the others soon disappeared behind the winding paths.

The wind and snow covered their tracks.

As dozens of foreign-race experts watched the group of six or seven Human Race experts disappear from view and looked at the remaining group of experts who had surrendered in front of the mountain, as well as the corpses of the lackeys and underlings of the Four Stars Sect, a range of complex emotions welled up in their hearts.

The only common emotion they had was an overwhelming sense of defeat.

Yes, it was defeat.

Every expert was well-aware of the amount of courage it took for one to walk up the mountain path. When they saw this group of six or seven Human Race experts disappear up the mountain path despite knowing that the entire group, including Ye Qingyu, could perish at the wrath of the Quasi-emperor, every foreign-race expert knew that this group of Human Race experts had chosen the correct path. This was the true path of a martial artist, so by choosing to remain where they were, they had lost to the fear of death that was within them. This would become a form of mental torture to them, and it would take a long time before they would be able to erase it from their heart of the martial way.

"Why didn't Ye Qingyu try to rouse us all to follow him? If he said a few words, I might have followed him."

Several younger foreign-race experts could not help thinking regretfully.

They were all once known as the Heaven's pridelings in their corner of the world and had been doted on by their teachers, friends, and even fate. They had always thought that they were unique and special, and it wasn't until they encountered Ye Qingyu that they realized that the ancient principle of how there is always someone better out there turned out to be true, and that compared to Ye Qingyu, they still had a long, long way to go.

The wind howled.

The only thing that these experts waiting at the foot of the mountain could do was to wait.

...

Ye Qingyu and the others made very slow progress.

After they walked three to four thousand meters along the winding path, they faced a sudden but terrifying pressure that appeared from the Void, or another possibility was that the earth's gravitational force had suddenly increased by a few hundred folds. So, as they trudged along the path, they felt as though they carried the weight of mountains with them. This frightening gravitational force seemed extremely heavy even to all these Saint realm experts.

As this heavy pressure crushed down on them, even the Great Saint experts were unable to rise into the air. They could only rely on their two feet to carry them along the mountain path.

"This is so goddamn tiring… My god, what kind of terrifying force is this?" the fatty Li Shengyan eked out breathlessly. He said with some annoyance, "Why do I feel as though the pressure increases another fold with each step I take?"

"You're right," Orchid Saintess said. "This should be the force field of a Quasi-emperor. Those who aren't powerful enough would never be able to approach a Quasi-emperor… Now that the authority of three Quasi-emperors has been released, its power will trap us within like prison gates. We… I'm afraid that we will be unable to reach the top of the mountain." She could not help glancing at Ye Qingyu as she said those words.

The further uphill they climbed, the more they were able to sense how mighty a Quasi-emperor was. These Quasi-emperors seemed so powerful that they felt hopeless in the face of such might.

Orchid Saintess felt that if anyone would be able to scale up the peak to witness the Dao battle of Quasi-emperors, it could only be Ye Qingyu. The others would probably only make it halfway up the mountain before they would be unable to withstand the terrifying pressure that crushed down on them.

It was clear that they would slowly become a burden to Ye Qingyu.

"Let's just treat it as some sort of training," Ye Qingyu said with a smile as he led the rest of the group. "Not everyone will get the opportunity to cultivate in the midst of a Quasi-emperor force field."

The moment he said that, the eyes of the rest of the group lit up. His words were indeed true.

If they didn't worry and fret about whether they would be able to reach the top of the mountain, putting aside their ultimate goal, everything would seem more optimistic as they treated this purely as an opportunity to cultivate and refine their cultivations.

Now that they had attained such high cultivation, it would be extremely rare for them to have such an opportunity again.

Only the fatty continued to pant heavily and grumble the entire way.

One hour later—

They had walked almost tenthousand meters up the mountain.

The mountain path was full of twists and turns, like the intestines of a sheep, and it would probably be another few tens of thousands of meters before they would reach the peak. It would be extremely difficult for them to accomplish this feat under such frightening circumstances and with the gravitational pull. And to make things worse, the terrifying gravitational pull would continue to increase with every meter.

"I can't move anymore."

Situ Kongming, who had the weakest cultivation of the group, decided to give up because he was no longer able to bear the crushing pressure.

He chose an empty spot and sat down cross-legged as he began to comprehend the mysteries of the Quasi-emperor's force field. He was trying to make use of this mighty pressure to push for a breakthrough on his own martial way.

Ye Qingyu nodded and did not say anything else. He continued to make his way forward.

He would not force them to make their way ahead if they weren't able to bear the pressure.

Otherwise, it could create adverse effects and even cause that martial artist to be killed by this force field.

Fifteen minutes later, the second person to drop out of the group was Tao Jieqian.

Zhang Wudao also dropped out soon afterward.

Surprisingly, it was the two female Saints, Tan Tianzi and Orchid Saintess, who managed to hang on for a longer period of time.

However, after another thirty minutes, these two female heroes were also no longer able to bear the pressure.

They ultimately decided to sit and cultivate within a mountain cave that had partially collapsed.

Then, the fatty and Ye Qingyu were the only two people left in the group.

Ye Qingyu's current strength meant that he was able to handle the pressure.

His physical cultivation was extremely mighty and he had climbed up the mountain path effortlessly thus far with his hands behind his back. He walked leisurely and used his heart to comprehend the power of this mysterious force field, attempting to find the origin of the Quasi-emperor's power within it. He truly treasured this opportunity to gradually comprehend the power of the Quasi-emperor from its weakest points to its strongest points, from its easiest parts to its most difficult parts. Thus, he had to make full use of this opportunity to increase his own strength.

As for the fatty...

He had resorted to crawling to push himself forward.

His current cultivation was around the standard of Tan Tianzi and the others, even if he tried to resist the pressure with all his might.

But he had managed to last so long because he was determined to climb up the peak to see his ancestor.

This fatty was both afraid of pain and death and perhaps also had developed this natural inclination after the Li family of the Ming Domain had fallen onto hard times and faced being hunted down or bullied by the various forces. One could imagine how much insult and pressure this fatty carried on his shoulders after his entire family had been killed and bullied to hang on to the tiny shred of hope that his family could still prosper once more. This fatty must have crawled along in the darkness for such a long time, finally finding hope again after finding Li Xiaofei in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. This was probably why the fatty was willing to die at the Black Demon Abyss if he could not rescue Li Xiaofei. And perhaps only someone like Ye Qingyu, who also had a similar experience wandering alone, could empathize with that fatty.

"Even if I have to crawl my way up, I have to make it to the top," the fatty clenched his jaw and swore to himself.

At that moment, he was truly relying on all four limbs to crawl forward, just like how a monkey climbs up a mountain.

Ye Qingyu did not make any move to help the fatty.

If the affairs of the world were a huge chessboard, then as a pawn, even if his progress was slow, no one would see him retreat.

Every person had their own destiny.

If the fatty truly managed to make it up to the mountain peak, then this feat would be a huge breakthrough for him in both his martial way and his mental state of mind.

Ye Qingyu continued to make his way up leisurely.

He could no longer see the fatty behind him fifteen minutes later.

This fatty was also surprisingly determined and did not ask Ye Qingyu for any help at all.

Ye Qingyu made his way up the winding path alone.

If this mountain path was compared to his martial way, despite the fact that he was accompanied by many teachers and advisors and also had friends with similar interests, he would ultimately have to make his way up to the pinnacle alone. Precious few people would be able to enjoy the view from the top, which was why there was a saying that it's lonely being in such a high position.

Since the beginning of time, there was only one way up the Capital Sky Peak.

He walked past a thin strip of sky, past the pine forest, the snowy low-lying land, the frozen lands, the narrow wooden road, single-plank stone bridge, icy maze cave, the drifting ice on the hot springs...

Climbing a mountain was like living out a life.

He saw many exotic scenes along the way and also came across many unexceptional and common views.

Isn't this just like life?

Just as there are grand and spectacular events, there are also common and quieter moments.

Ye Qingyu took in the view as he strode along the path, as though he was truly a tourist admiring the scenery.

Approximately two hours later, Ye Qingyu also started to sweat.

His entire body was drenched in sweat but he felt more comfortable and relaxed than he had ever been.

He felt extremely pleased, just like how uplifted a tourist would feel when soaking in an amazing view after a long trek. It was as though his mind and soul had been cleansed, with white bubbling mist swirling around his body. When he exhaled, he realized that the air he exhaled was also white.

Then, he stopped.

There was a cliff up ahead.

This cliff was thousands of meters deep, and at the edge of it, a man sat cross-legged in the midst of the snowstorm with snow covering his entire body. Only the long spear that laid horizontally across his knees was completely untouched by the snow.

Chapter 1011:


Chapter 1026 - Overcoming All Difficulties
"You took a while to get here," the snow man said.
"Were you waiting for me?" Ye Qingyu smiled and continued, "If I rushed over, I would have missed out on many beautiful views."
"If you continue making your way forward, there will be five checkpoints you'll need to pass. It won't be an easy task making your way up this mountain," the snow man said as he slowly rose to his feet and held his long spear with both hands. Then, abundant energy that was as full as the sun slowly unfurled and the snow that covered his body instantly disappeared to reveal his burly feature, handsome and tough features, as well as an undeniable will to fight.
Ye Qingyu nodded and said, "Your Highness, many thanks for your guidance. Are you the guardian of the first checkpoint?"
The snow man was none other than the third prince of the Mzar Race, Yin Kaishan.
He didn't deny it either and answered, "You're right. I'm the guardian."
"If the matchless third prince of the Mizar Race is the guardian of the first checkpoint, then the remaining four checkpoints would be even more challenging," Ye Qingyu's expression changed slightly. Although he had never exchanged blows with the third prince of the Mizar Race, he knew how terrifyingly powerful the Heaven's pride of the Mizar Race was. Yang Wanqu, the Young Lord of Sinful Pit and the others paled in comparison to him. This was the true top-level Heaven's pride and before Ye Qingyu's period of self-isolation, he had even speculated that if he were to run into the third prince of the Mizar Race, he would definitely find it challenging to beat him.
"I don't know who other guardians of the next few checkpoints are," Yin Kaishan the third prince of the Mizar Race said. "However, you're right to deduce that they are all terrifying. They are so powerful to the point that I wouldn't dare to face them."
"But I need to scale the mountain, so I guess I'll just have to pass through one checkpoint at a time," Ye Qingyu said with a smile. Then, the white mist that swirled around him together with all his sweat suddenly vanished without a trace. He looked like he was in great spirits as he did some stretches and said, "I've long wanted to battle against the third prince. With all due respect, it is my opinion that very few experts throughout the Vast Thousand Worlds live up to their title as a Heaven's Pride and you're the only one who ignites my will to fight."
Yin Kaishan was slightly surprised by Ye Qingyu's words.
He had planned to say these words to Ye Qingyu but to his surprise, Ye Qingyu said these words before he did.
At that moment, he suddenly respected Ye Qingyu as a fellow hero.
Yin Kaishan was well-aware of the foreign domains' perception of him in recent years and knew that they had labeled him as a fool who had been bewitched by the Four Stars Holy Girl. This was the same opinion that many within the imperial court of the Mizar Race held as well. He knew that they despised him beneath their respectful facade and he had seen too many people who had the same reaction, including those who knew him extremely well.
Therefore, he hadn't expected Ye Qingyu who he had only met a few times on opposing sides to hold such a high opinion of him.
If anyone else had said those words, Yin Kaishan would've probably brushed it off and remained unmoved but since those words came from Ye Qingyu, the weight and significance that they held were completely different.
"Look below at the myriad of foreign races who have gathered. They are like a heap of loose sand," Yin Kaishan used the tip of his spear to point toward the bottom of the cliff and said, "You've made a wise choice by not encouraging these foreign races to follow you."
Ye Qingyu took a few steps forward to stand beside Yin Kaishan and looked down at the scene below.
Through the snowstorm, he could clearly see the bottom of the mountain where he had battled earlier from this vantage point. Almost 10,000 foreign race experts continued to wait at the vast plains outside the entrance to the mountain path and as he looked down at this group from above, they indeed resembled an army of ants. It was had to associate these group with the top-level experts of the Vast Thousand Worlds that they were supposed to be from this angle.
The authority of Quasi-Emperors pervaded the entire Capital Sky Peak so the foreign race experts at the foot of the mountain would naturally not be able to spot them above and wouldn't know that they were being watched.
Ye Qingyu realized that Yin Kaishan must've witnessed his astonishing battle earlier on.
"I'm not sure if I'd be able to defeat you," Yin Kaishan said as he retracted his long spear. "Please go ahead."
Ye Qingyu was slightly stunned.
"Many thanks," he didn't stand on ceremony either.
Although meeting Yin Kaishan had ignited a strong combat will in him, it clearly wasn't the best time for them to battle.
He saluted him with both hands, then he walked to the edge of the cliff and leaped up in the void. There was another cliff that was about 10 meters away and after he landed, the winding mountain paths reappeared. As he headed up the mountain earlier, he had already noticed that the path up the mountain was on the other end of the cliff. However, since the Quasi-Emperor's mighty force field blanketed this entire area, it would have been extremely hard even for an average Great Saint to jump even 10 meters. The difficulty level was pretty high.
Fortunately, it was only a distance of 10 meters, so it was nothing to him.
Yin Kaishan who was standing on the opposite end of the cliff let out a soft sigh.
Even without the Four Stars Holy Girl's instruction for him not to engage Ye Qingyu, he wouldn't have attacked either.
"He's an outstanding talent who managed to kill 10,000 single-handedly. I don't want to make things even difficult for you under such circumstances. I hope that you'll truly be able to fulfill your wish of scaling the mountain peak to look at the most beautiful and frightening view in the world!"
He gazed after Ye Qingyu as he disappeared along the winding paths.
"The guardian of the second checkpoint was still someone from the Four Stars Sect… What exactly is the relationship between the Four Stars Sect and the 'camp'?"
Ye Qingyu wiped the blood off his sword.
Knife qi and sword slash marks could be seen all around the surrounding mountain face and ice rocks and there was a dead body 10 meters away. All signs showed that a fierce battle had just ended.
Ye Qingyu had seen his opponent before – he was a guardian Great Saint who was by the Four Stars Holy Girl's side.
His opponent was a peerless expert well-versed in knife techniques and his knife qi, knife radiance, knife will, and knife force were all extremely powerful. He would have probably ranked amongst the top 10 knife experts of this generation.
Under normal circumstances, this highly skilled knife Great Saint expert would have probably failed to even handle three blows from Ye Qingyu but since they were on the Capital Sky Peak where the Quasi-Emperor's mighty force field pervaded the entire area, this changed everything since it suppressed their yuan qi and rendered many divine skills and occult techniques useless. This meant that the simple and purest form of wielding a weapon became even more terrifying. Once this Great Saint held his knife, he would be able to effortlessly kill an army of 1,000. With him guarding the checkpoint, even 10,000 men might find it hard to get through the checkpoint on his watch.
Even Yin Kaishan would probably not be his match under such circumstances.
This was likely why the Four Stars Sect had confidently assigned him to guard the second checkpoint.
Unfortunately, his opponent was Ye Qingyu who was an almighty swordsman with an incredible grasp of the way of the sword.
When they battled purely by relying on their moves, Ye Qingyu killed his opponent in 50 moves.
Who would be the third guardian?
Ye Qingyu continued to make his way along the mountain path.
He arrived at the third checkpoint two hours later.
It was a bridge formed out of a single rock that was 100 meters long and only wide enough for one person. This bridge connected two peaks that were 30,000 meters tall and an extremely deep abyss was beneath the bridge. Cloud and mist swirled around and the abyss was so deep that it seemed bottomless. Due to the Quasi-Emperor force field that blanketed the surrounding area, Ye Qingyu would only be able to leap slightly more than a dozen meters with his current physical cultivation. If he fell from the stone bridge, he would be seriously injured even if he escaped death. Most importantly, if he fell, that would mean that he would need to start his journey all over again.
A burly figure clad in a crimson dragon armor stood on the stone bridge as the winds billowed around him.
He was a middle-aged man who looked around 30 years of age. He was much taller and bulkier than an average Human but his burliness didn’t make him seem overly corpulent. On the other hand, he exuded a vibe that was both striking and full of youthful vigor. He looked extremely handsome and also exuded an air of elegance, which was further highlighted by his crimson dragon armor. He looked like an otherworldly and distinguished god of war. He carried a blood-colored halberd that swirled with reddish-black mist and this was clearly a frightening weapon that had the ability to kill countless mighty experts.
This middle-aged person's appearance looked very similar to that of the Human Race but the two golden horns that protruded out of his forehead definitely marked him as a non-Human.
Dragon Human Race!
Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.
He hadn't expected to run into Dragon Human Race experts in this place.
Since the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor descended upon Clear River Domain, he hadn't encountered a single Dragon Human Race expert within at all.
From this person’s outstanding aura and elegance, it showed that he held a powerful position amongst the Dragon Human Race.
Could he be
？
A name that he had heard far too many times suddenly flashed past his mind.
He slowly stepped onto the narrow stone bridge.
"Hand it over," the Dragon Human Race said coolly when he saw Ye Qingyu approach him but his gaze was assessing as he looked at Ye Qingyu, as though he was coming to some sort of decision. The Dragon Human Race expert slowly stretched out his hand when Ye Qingyu was approximately 10 steps away from him.
Ye Qingyu clearly knew what he was after.
"I've handed this over to the Dragon Human Race experts twice but it doesn't seem to want to remain in the hands of the Dragon Humans," Ye Qingyu reached out into the void behind him and summoned the Dragonblood Halberd. "We'll just have to see if it acknowledges you as its master."
Then, he flung the Dragonblood Halberd at his opponent.
The Dragon Human Race expert raised his hand and caught the Dragonblood Halberd.
He smiled confidently and said, "If I, Xu Wuya, fail to bring this halberd back to my Race, then it shall henceforth belong to the Ice Sword Killing God”The moment he held the Dragonblood Halberd, it vibrated slightly but this vibration was different from the previous two times it vibrated when it was held by the third princess of the Dragon Human Race. When she held it, it vibrated to struggle out of her hands but this time, it was a joyful vibration as though it had finally found its master and it let out a series of dragon hums that echoed throughout the valley.
Xu Wuya?
He mentally pulled out all the information he had on Xu Wuya.
So this was the legendary war god of the Dragonblood Dynasty, the commander of the Dragon Teeth Army, Xu Wuya.
After the Dragonblood Dynasty fell apart due to the death of the retired emperor of the Dragon Human Race, the commander of the Dragon Teeth Army Xu Wuya was determined to take action and made a series of preparations, defied the edict of the current Dragon Human emperor to act on his own accord. He wanted to open the domain gate of Heaven Wasteland Domain and invade the domain and even proclaimed that the entire domain must be annihilated. He was a classic aggressive character who advocated war and his stance was extremely firm and hard-line.
He hadn't expected Xu Wuya to appear here.
Did this mean that the Dragonblood Dynasty and the Four Stars Sect have formed an alliance?
"Since you've returned the Dragonblood Halberd to me, I'll let you execute the first three moves," Xu Wuya's aura skyrocketed once he held the Dragonblood Halberd and red mist swirled around him along with multiple rays of true dragon phantoms. He was extremely powerful. This ancestral weapon of the Dragon Human Race didn't seem to be constrained by the Quasi-Emperor force field and looked as though it could still be wielded effectively. Ye Qingyu felt his heart skip a beat.
The guardian of the third checkpoint was none other than Xu Wuya.
Chapter 1026 - Overcoming All Difficulties


"You took a while to get here," the snow man said.

"Were you waiting for me?" Ye Qingyu smiled and continued, "If I rushed over, I would have missed out on many beautiful views."

"If you continue making your way forward, there will be five checkpoints you'll need to pass. It won't be an easy task making your way up this mountain," the snow man said as he slowly rose to his feet and held his long spear with both hands. Then, abundant energy that was as full as the sun slowly unfurled and the snow that covered his body instantly disappeared to reveal his burly feature, handsome and tough features, as well as an undeniable will to fight.

Ye Qingyu nodded and said, "Your Highness, many thanks for your guidance. Are you the guardian of the first checkpoint?"

The snow man was none other than the third prince of the Mzar Race, Yin Kaishan.

He didn't deny it either and answered, "You're right. I'm the guardian."

"If the matchless third prince of the Mizar Race is the guardian of the first checkpoint, then the remaining four checkpoints would be even more challenging," Ye Qingyu's expression changed slightly. Although he had never exchanged blows with the third prince of the Mizar Race, he knew how terrifyingly powerful the Heaven's pride of the Mizar Race was. Yang Wanqu, the Young Lord of Sinful Pit and the others paled in comparison to him. This was the true top-level Heaven's pride and before Ye Qingyu's period of self-isolation, he had even speculated that if he were to run into the third prince of the Mizar Race, he would definitely find it challenging to beat him.

"I don't know who other guardians of the next few checkpoints are," Yin Kaishan the third prince of the Mizar Race said. "However, you're right to deduce that they are all terrifying. They are so powerful to the point that I wouldn't dare to face them."

"But I need to scale the mountain, so I guess I'll just have to pass through one checkpoint at a time," Ye Qingyu said with a smile. Then, the white mist that swirled around him together with all his sweat suddenly vanished without a trace. He looked like he was in great spirits as he did some stretches and said, "I've long wanted to battle against the third prince. With all due respect, it is my opinion that very few experts throughout the Vast Thousand Worlds live up to their title as a Heaven's Pride and you're the only one who ignites my will to fight."

Yin Kaishan was slightly surprised by Ye Qingyu's words.

He had planned to say these words to Ye Qingyu but to his surprise, Ye Qingyu said these words before he did.

At that moment, he suddenly respected Ye Qingyu as a fellow hero.

Yin Kaishan was well-aware of the foreign domains' perception of him in recent years and knew that they had labeled him as a fool who had been bewitched by the Four Stars Holy Girl. This was the same opinion that many within the imperial court of the Mizar Race held as well. He knew that they despised him beneath their respectful facade and he had seen too many people who had the same reaction, including those who knew him extremely well.

Therefore, he hadn't expected Ye Qingyu who he had only met a few times on opposing sides to hold such a high opinion of him.

If anyone else had said those words, Yin Kaishan would've probably brushed it off and remained unmoved but since those words came from Ye Qingyu, the weight and significance that they held were completely different.

"Look below at the myriad of foreign races who have gathered. They are like a heap of loose sand," Yin Kaishan used the tip of his spear to point toward the bottom of the cliff and said, "You've made a wise choice by not encouraging these foreign races to follow you."

Ye Qingyu took a few steps forward to stand beside Yin Kaishan and looked down at the scene below.

Through the snowstorm, he could clearly see the bottom of the mountain where he had battled earlier from this vantage point. Almost 10,000 foreign race experts continued to wait at the vast plains outside the entrance to the mountain path and as he looked down at this group from above, they indeed resembled an army of ants. It was had to associate these group with the top-level experts of the Vast Thousand Worlds that they were supposed to be from this angle.

The authority of Quasi-Emperors pervaded the entire Capital Sky Peak so the foreign race experts at the foot of the mountain would naturally not be able to spot them above and wouldn't know that they were being watched.

Ye Qingyu realized that Yin Kaishan must've witnessed his astonishing battle earlier on.

"I'm not sure if I'd be able to defeat you," Yin Kaishan said as he retracted his long spear. "Please go ahead."

Ye Qingyu was slightly stunned.

"Many thanks," he didn't stand on ceremony either.

Although meeting Yin Kaishan had ignited a strong combat will in him, it clearly wasn't the best time for them to battle.

He saluted him with both hands, then he walked to the edge of the cliff and leaped up in the void. There was another cliff that was about 10 meters away and after he landed, the winding mountain paths reappeared. As he headed up the mountain earlier, he had already noticed that the path up the mountain was on the other end of the cliff. However, since the Quasi-Emperor's mighty force field blanketed this entire area, it would have been extremely hard even for an average Great Saint to jump even 10 meters. The difficulty level was pretty high.

Fortunately, it was only a distance of 10 meters, so it was nothing to him.

Yin Kaishan who was standing on the opposite end of the cliff let out a soft sigh.

Even without the Four Stars Holy Girl's instruction for him not to engage Ye Qingyu, he wouldn't have attacked either.

"He's an outstanding talent who managed to kill 10,000 single-handedly. I don't want to make things even difficult for you under such circumstances. I hope that you'll truly be able to fulfill your wish of scaling the mountain peak to look at the most beautiful and frightening view in the world!"

He gazed after Ye Qingyu as he disappeared along the winding paths.

"The guardian of the second checkpoint was still someone from the Four Stars Sect… What exactly is the relationship between the Four Stars Sect and the 'camp'?"

Ye Qingyu wiped the blood off his sword.

Knife qi and sword slash marks could be seen all around the surrounding mountain face and ice rocks and there was a dead body 10 meters away. All signs showed that a fierce battle had just ended.

Ye Qingyu had seen his opponent before – he was a guardian Great Saint who was by the Four Stars Holy Girl's side.

His opponent was a peerless expert well-versed in knife techniques and his knife qi, knife radiance, knife will, and knife force were all extremely powerful. He would have probably ranked amongst the top 10 knife experts of this generation.

Under normal circumstances, this highly skilled knife Great Saint expert would have probably failed to even handle three blows from Ye Qingyu but since they were on the Capital Sky Peak where the Quasi-Emperor's mighty force field pervaded the entire area, this changed everything since it suppressed their yuan qi and rendered many divine skills and occult techniques useless. This meant that the simple and purest form of wielding a weapon became even more terrifying. Once this Great Saint held his knife, he would be able to effortlessly kill an army of 1,000. With him guarding the checkpoint, even 10,000 men might find it hard to get through the checkpoint on his watch.

Even Yin Kaishan would probably not be his match under such circumstances.

This was likely why the Four Stars Sect had confidently assigned him to guard the second checkpoint.

Unfortunately, his opponent was Ye Qingyu who was an almighty swordsman with an incredible grasp of the way of the sword.

When they battled purely by relying on their moves, Ye Qingyu killed his opponent in 50 moves.

Who would be the third guardian?

Ye Qingyu continued to make his way along the mountain path.

He arrived at the third checkpoint two hours later.

It was a bridge formed out of a single rock that was 100 meters long and only wide enough for one person. This bridge connected two peaks that were 30,000 meters tall and an extremely deep abyss was beneath the bridge. Cloud and mist swirled around and the abyss was so deep that it seemed bottomless. Due to the Quasi-Emperor force field that blanketed the surrounding area, Ye Qingyu would only be able to leap slightly more than a dozen meters with his current physical cultivation. If he fell from the stone bridge, he would be seriously injured even if he escaped death. Most importantly, if he fell, that would mean that he would need to start his journey all over again.

A burly figure clad in a crimson dragon armor stood on the stone bridge as the winds billowed around him.

He was a middle-aged man who looked around 30 years of age. He was much taller and bulkier than an average Human but his burliness didn’t make him seem overly corpulent. On the other hand, he exuded a vibe that was both striking and full of youthful vigor. He looked extremely handsome and also exuded an air of elegance, which was further highlighted by his crimson dragon armor. He looked like an otherworldly and distinguished god of war. He carried a blood-colored halberd that swirled with reddish-black mist and this was clearly a frightening weapon that had the ability to kill countless mighty experts.

This middle-aged person's appearance looked very similar to that of the Human Race but the two golden horns that protruded out of his forehead definitely marked him as a non-Human.

Dragon Human Race!

Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.

He hadn't expected to run into Dragon Human Race experts in this place.

Since the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor descended upon Clear River Domain, he hadn't encountered a single Dragon Human Race expert within at all.

From this person’s outstanding aura and elegance, it showed that he held a powerful position amongst the Dragon Human Race.

Could he be
？

A name that he had heard far too many times suddenly flashed past his mind.

He slowly stepped onto the narrow stone bridge.

"Hand it over," the Dragon Human Race said coolly when he saw Ye Qingyu approach him but his gaze was assessing as he looked at Ye Qingyu, as though he was coming to some sort of decision. The Dragon Human Race expert slowly stretched out his hand when Ye Qingyu was approximately 10 steps away from him.

Ye Qingyu clearly knew what he was after.

"I've handed this over to the Dragon Human Race experts twice but it doesn't seem to want to remain in the hands of the Dragon Humans," Ye Qingyu reached out into the void behind him and summoned the Dragonblood Halberd. "We'll just have to see if it acknowledges you as its master."

Then, he flung the Dragonblood Halberd at his opponent.

The Dragon Human Race expert raised his hand and caught the Dragonblood Halberd.

He smiled confidently and said, "If I, Xu Wuya, fail to bring this halberd back to my Race, then it shall henceforth belong to the Ice Sword Killing God”The moment he held the Dragonblood Halberd, it vibrated slightly but this vibration was different from the previous two times it vibrated when it was held by the third princess of the Dragon Human Race. When she held it, it vibrated to struggle out of her hands but this time, it was a joyful vibration as though it had finally found its master and it let out a series of dragon hums that echoed throughout the valley.

Xu Wuya?

He mentally pulled out all the information he had on Xu Wuya.

So this was the legendary war god of the Dragonblood Dynasty, the commander of the Dragon Teeth Army, Xu Wuya.

After the Dragonblood Dynasty fell apart due to the death of the retired emperor of the Dragon Human Race, the commander of the Dragon Teeth Army Xu Wuya was determined to take action and made a series of preparations, defied the edict of the current Dragon Human emperor to act on his own accord. He wanted to open the domain gate of Heaven Wasteland Domain and invade the domain and even proclaimed that the entire domain must be annihilated. He was a classic aggressive character who advocated war and his stance was extremely firm and hard-line.

He hadn't expected Xu Wuya to appear here.

Did this mean that the Dragonblood Dynasty and the Four Stars Sect have formed an alliance?

"Since you've returned the Dragonblood Halberd to me, I'll let you execute the first three moves," Xu Wuya's aura skyrocketed once he held the Dragonblood Halberd and red mist swirled around him along with multiple rays of true dragon phantoms. He was extremely powerful. This ancestral weapon of the Dragon Human Race didn't seem to be constrained by the Quasi-Emperor force field and looked as though it could still be wielded effectively. Ye Qingyu felt his heart skip a beat.

The guardian of the third checkpoint was none other than Xu Wuya.

========================================

Chapter 1012:


Chapter 1027 – A Tiny Part of the Four Stars Sect Would Continue to Live On


Two hours later—

Ye Qingyu passed the third checkpoint.

His battle with the [Dragonblood War God], Xu Wuya, had come to an end.

He had barely won by one move to move past this checkpoint.

This battle had merely determined the victor, but it wasn't a life and death battle.

The way the battle had ended was completely different from what he had initially expected. He thought that someone as aggressive as Xu Wuya would have borne immense hatred toward him because of the retired Emperor's death and he assumed that a life and death battle was unavoidable. But who knew…

Xu Wuya is a rather remarkable character. I'm surprised he dared to do something like that in the presence of Quasi-emperors.

Ye Qingyu was still extremely surprised when he thought back to what had happened earlier.

Nonetheless, it was still a good outcome.

At the very least, it showed that the situation throughout the Vast Thousand Domains was not as dire as he had thought.

As he continued to make his way up the mountain path, the all-encompassing pressure intensified.

"If it had been any ordinary Great Saint, his bones would've probably been completely crushed in the face of such intense pressure by this point in time," Ye Qingyu speculated. The mighty authority of Quasi-emperors had become unbelievably intense and more astonishing, but this authority only seemed to affect living creatures. The mountains, rocks, snow, and icy rocks remained completely immune to this authority.

Ye Qingyu carefully sensed this authority.

The authority of a Quasi-emperor was a manifestation of the Quasi-emperor's Dao.

If he wanted to go up against a Quasi-emperor, he had to first understand the Quasi-emperor's Dao.

When he told the Third Prince of the Mizar Race earlier that if he rushed over, then he'd be missing out on the many beautiful views, what he really meant was, if he walked too quickly, he would've been unable to truly form an in-depth understanding of the Quasi-emperor's authority.

He finally arrived at the fourth checkpoint after an hour.

The guardians of the fourth checkpoint were three Peak Great Saints from the Four Stars Sect. They looked extremely wizened, as though they had crawled out of their graves, and their bodies swirled with an aura of decay. They looked like exact copies of each other—their sparse and dry white hair covered their dry scalps, and their skin was like a dried orange peel and was weathered with age. They looked as though they could be blown into dust by a gust of wind as they tottered unsteadily on their feet, unable to stand firmly in the midst of the billowing wind and snow. Even their clothes looked very ancient and were not from this era.

These were probably the so-called resources that the Four Stars Sect could have drawn on. They were old monsters who looked like they belonged to a bygone era.

Ye Qingyu did not understand why these old monsters were assigned to this checkpoint. Were they sent here to die? He could not sense any trace of energy that signified that they were stronger than the Third Prince of the Mizar Race or the Dragonblood War God on these three ancient Great Saints, who looked like they had just come out of self-imposed isolation. Their cultivation meant that they were probably only as strong as the highly-skilled knife expert from the second checkpoint, so they were not incredibly powerful either.

The experts who entered self-imposed isolation in a bid to extend their lifespan would find that they would enter a state of self-actualization after they emerged from their period of isolation. Even after they regained their strength, they would only have the energy to fight one last battle. And once their final battle ended, they would definitely perish regardless of the result of the battle.

Theoretically, it did not make sense for the Four Stars Sect to assign these kinds of experts to guard this checkpoint.

After all, these experts were like disposable consumables. Every time an expert was sent out, it meant that they would be down by one.

"Seniors, please let me pass." Ye Qingyu saluted them with both hands. After all, these were the ancestors of the Human Race. They were also ancient Great Saints who lived a thousand years ago, and they might have even once made contributions to the progress of the Human Race. Frankly, these wizened experts had very little to do with the current people in charge of the Four Stars Sect, so Ye Qingyu did not wish to spill the blood of heroes.

"Cough cough cough…" The elderly Great Saint standing in the middle of the trio coughed so hard that it seemed like he was about to cough his lungs out. He looked at Ye Qingyu as though he was looking at their glorious former selves from centuries ago, then he tottered unsteadily toward Ye Qingyu and said, "It's great to be young. Cough cough! We know who you are and admire you for your achievements, but unfortunately… Cough cough! we're already tired of living, and since there are others who want us dead, it would be an honor for us to die at your hands…"

He looked extremely miserable.

He was a hero who was past his prime.

His hair was like snow.

These three elderly men stood side by side in the snowstorm as though they were one entity. They reached back into the Void and suddenly three giant swords made of snow appeared in their hands.

"My brothers, we entered the Four Stars Sect together three thousand years ago and also reached the Great Saint realm together two thousand years ago. Together, we got rid of evil as countless foreign-race experts and nefarious characters were felled by our swords. We then decided to enter into self-imposed isolation together one thousand years ago. Today, we shall experience for ourselves the sword skills of the most outstanding Human Race expert of his generation!" the elderly man at the far left cried out passionately.

The moment these snow swords appeared in their hands, their stooping bodies immediately straightened up and they stood as upright as long spears. Their auras suddenly skyrocketed and all traces of decay and age vanished without a trace. They looked like they had been reborn as their white hair reverted to black, their sparse hair became abundant, their skin tightened, and their gazes became as sharp as swords.

Instantly, the trio turned from tottering elderly men into handsome young men, full of vitality.

They were all extremely handsome and elegant.

They were a trio of matchless swordsmen.

"After sleeping for one thousand years, I truly feel as though I've just crawled out from my grave. If I had known how evil this world would have become, I'd have chosen to die a thousand years ago," the elderly expert on the right said as he flicked his sword, which then released a long howl. He looked like a young man who was about to run wild.

"The Four Stars Sect is no longer the Four Stars Sect that we once knew. We're not only expendable but we would also become a hindrance to them if we continued to live." The swordsman in the middle was unable to hide the despair in his eyes. The hopelessness in his eyes was not just there because his life was about to come to an end, it also reflected how he felt about the current state of the world.

The swordsman on the left laughed loudly as his gaze fell on Ye Qingyu. He nodded approvingly and said, "Brother, the three of us have lived our lives to the fullest and we'll die with no regrets today. Furthermore, now that we've lived long enough to be able to witness the emergence of such an outstanding Human Race expert, who seems to be even more powerful than Li Xiaofei had been back then, why would we die with any regrets?"

"You're right. We'll die without regrets," the swordsman on the right said as his expression calmed and the wildness left his face.

The swordsman in the middle smiled and nodded. "Alright… young man, my brothers and I have developed our own set of sword techniques from the supreme sword manual of the Four Stars Sect—the [Four Stars Heavenly Jade Scriptures]. There are countless divine and mysterious techniques within the Four Stars Sect, but these techniques have all evolved from the [Four Stars Heavenly Jade Scriptures]. If you wish to go against that Quasi-emperor, then we'll have to see how much you'll be able to comprehend from our sword techniques."

Then, his snow sword shook.

Sword light filled the sky, then rained down on Ye Qingyu unstoppably.

The trio attacked at the same time.

Endless rays of sword light covered the sky and sword qi skyrocketed to the heavens.

Ye Qingyu did not dare to hesitate as he transformed the cold ice and green wind into two long swords to counter their attacks.

These three ancient experts of the Four Stars Sect were extremely skilled swordsmen of their era, and although they had been unable to become Emperors and had failed to draw on their way of the sword to reach the Quasi-emperor realm, even a Quasi-emperor might not be able to match their prowess in the way of the sword. By battling these masters, Ye Qingyu found his comprehension of the [War God Sword Mantras] improve tremendously.

Sword qi pervaded the surroundings.

Sword light pierced through the heavens.

This phenomenon persisted for an hour.

Suddenly, the sword light that had filled the air suddenly retracted.

These three master swordsmen retreated as one.

"Hahaha, I've slept for one thousand years for a battle like this. Great, this feels amazing."

"I've cultivated the way of the sword for four thousand years and once killed many enemies in dangerous situations. I was worried that I'd be unable to impart my knowledge, but today, I've finally found a successor. Hahaha, I've fulfilled my wishes and will die without regrets."

"Young man, you've already witnessed the mysteries of the sword method of the Four Stars Sect. It's up to you now to wield this knowledge effectively. The three of us have dedicated our entire lives to the way of the sword and had once dreamt of drawing on this sword method to become Emperors. Unfortunately, our efforts came to naught. We've done our research on you, and if we were to judge you purely based on your swordsmanship, we would consider you to be the best this world has to offer. Perhaps you might be able to achieve what the three of us have failed to do."

These three master swordsmen piped up one after another.

A terrifying change occurred after they spoke.

Their handsome and young bodies suddenly aged incredibly quickly and they instantly lost all their luster, collapsing like sand sculptures that had been blown by the wind. Their skin scattered across the sky, their hair fell off their heads, and the muscles in their bodies scattered like sand in the wind, revealing their bones underneath.

"If you are truly able to become an Emperor one day by drawing upon the way of the sword, then a tiny part of the Four Stars Sect would continue to live on."

The elderly man in the middle had turned into dust before he could complete his final sentence.

Ye Qingyu remained quietly where he was.

He had to pass through five checkpoints on the way to the peak. The first was the Third Prince of the Mizar Race; then the [Dragonblood War God]; followed by these three ancient experts of the Four Stars Sect… He had assumed that there would be enormous bloodshed and fierce battles to be fought, but now that things had turned out this way, he felt as though it was more taxing on his spirit rather than the fierce battles he had been expecting.

"Many thanks for your tutelage."

Ye Qingyu turned to the Void and bowed respectfully.

These three people had once been matchless swordsmen of their era but were now forced to be the guardians of a checkpoint by their own kind.

The people who had put them in this position only cared about their final value and merely wanted to send them to their deaths. It did not matter to these people whether these swordsmen lived or died since they would ultimately die anyway. These swordsmen were part of an alternative voice of the Four Stars Sect, and this was a voice that those who controlled the sect no longer wished to hear.

These three elderly men were forced to appear.

After all, they were forever recognized as disciples of the Four Stars Sect.

Some might have already forgotten the vows they had made when they first entered the sect four thousand years ago, but they had always kept their vows close to their hearts.

However, they used their swordsmanship skills to show that they were not on the side of the current Quasi-emperor of their sect and used their lives to prove their loyalty to their sect. More importantly, they showed through their actions that not all hope was lost for a top-level Human Race sect like the Four Stars Sect. At the very least, they had once been part of the golden age of the Human Race.

Most importantly, they displayed the true martial way of the Four Stars Sect through their swordsmanship skills.

This was what affected Ye Qingyu most.

How much boldness and courage did it take for them to do that?

Ye Qingyu suddenly felt more heartened about the fate of the Human Race.

Men could fall and so could entire sects.

If men could realize their mistakes and turn over a new leaf, then the same could happen to sects.

Ye Qingyu came to the sudden realization that it wasn't only the venerable and godly Li Xiaofei who guarded the morals of the Human Race, but there were also thousands of others who shared a similar mindset. He did not realize it before because he had yet to encounter these three venerable elderly men. The fact that he kept encountering evil characters did not mean that everyone in the world was evil. If he continued to walk forward, he would ultimately meet those who were upright and righteous.

These three seniors had torn a crack through the gloominess in his heart to reveal a tiny glimmer of sunlight.

A tiny part of the Four Stars Sect would live on!

I will.

Ye Qingyu made a silent promise to these three elderly men.

There were five checkpoints and he had already made his way past four.

There was one remaining checkpoint left.

Who could it be?

After Ye Qingyu finished bowing, he continued to make his way up the mountain path.

He could already make out the outline of the top of Capital Sky Peak in the distance.
