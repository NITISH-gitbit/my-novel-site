Chapter 357:


358 - Standing for ten days

Time passed by second after second.

In the blink of an eye, another two hours had passed by.

On the arena.

The black-robed young man who had always remained silent, [Shadow], suddenly opened his eyes. HIs figure crumpled, bowing to the ground. Both his hands supported him on the ground, his mouth opened to let out a jet of black blood that was like a geyser. A stench of rotting flesh instantly began emantating in the air all around.

The young experts all had shock in their faces.

There were people that wanted to charge onto the arena to support [Shadow].

"Don't move! don't touch him."

The black-robed young man, [Shadow], was half kneeling on the ground. He kept vomiting blood on the floor, and more than half the arena was nearly submerged by his pitch black rotting blood. If this continued on, it was likely that all the blood in his body would be vomited out.

If he was a normal person, losing so much blood would have long turned him into a corpse.

But he was a martial existence who had already taken half a step into being a top level expert. There was much more blood in his body than a normal person.

This was known as qi blood being like the ocean. For true top level experts, the blood contained within their body surged like a river. According to the rumours, those experts who had reached such heights that they could chase the wind and harvest the moon and had cultivated to its extreme, a droplet of blood could transform into an ocean. When they had entered the state of a Sage, an Emperor, this was furthermore something a normal person could not imagine.

[Shadow] was someone whose strength was second only to Ye Qingyu amongst the eighteen experts. He had already taken half a step into being ranked as a top level expert. Therefore the blood in his body was like a stream. Such a loss of blood would naturally not pose any sort of fatal danger to him. It was only that it would weaken his body and cause him to lose his vigour. He needed to rest and recuperate for a few days before he could truly recover.

Furthermore, the black-coloured blood he spat out was in reality some unknown impurities caused by the injuries in his body when he fell into a state of demonic fire. Ye Qingyu had imitated that mysterious skinny old man in White Deer Academy. Using the power of the [Dragon Fist], he forcefully suppressed the evilness of the demonic fire in [Shadow's] body, forcing out the decaying blood in his body.

However, Ye Qingyu's strength could not be truly referred to as top level. He had only forcefully shifted the black blood into Shadow's intestine. There was no way of ejecting it out of his body.

Therefore, [Shadow] had needed to vomit like so.

In the next fifteen minutes, [Shadow] vomited out nearly black decaying blood ten times the volume of his own body.

On the arena, apart from where Ye Qingyu stood three meters away, the other places were all filled with decaying black blood.

Then he slowly stood up.

His figure shook, feeling lacking in strength. But the symptoms of falling in demonic fire had all disappeared. The yuan qi in his body flowed smoothly and calmly. Activating his qi, he felt indescribably comfortable. Such a supreme feeling was like his entire person was reborn. His spirit was flourishing and complete.

His tribulation had passed.

Not only had it passed away, his cultivation had became even more intricate. The bottleneck that he had encountered, he had broken through just like that.

He wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth. His expression was complicated as he stared at Ye Qingyu staring opposite him. Ultimately, he did not even say a single word as he turned and jumped off the arena. He paid his respects to the instructors that guarded them, then instantly returned to the dormitory.

Bao Shinu and the battle technique instructor smiled.

They could already see the change within [Shadow].

Such a change was not only a change in his cultivation and strength. It was also a transformation in his heart and personality.

"Order people to prepare the meal and add another two pounds of Origin crystal to be given to [Shadow]." The battle technique instructor gave his instructions. Very quickly, tens of soldiers, carrying large basket after large basket of food delivered it to the dormitory.

But the large majority of gazes were still focused on Ye Qingyu.

Right now, Ye Qingyu was still silently standing with closed eyes on the arena.

His breathing was neither fast nor slow, and there was not the slightest hint of yuan qi fluctuation in his body, as if he had fallen asleep.

"Don't disturb him."

Bao Shinu only again let out a shout.

He was not clear on what state Ye Qingyu was in, but it should be something good. It was similar to enlightenment, and it must not be disturbed by them. For martial experts, such a state could only be encountered but not wished for. People gaining enlightenment into the Dao was like so. Right now, breaking Ye Qingyu's enlightenment was like killing his father or stealing his wife.

Both instructors began guarding him.

After observing for a while, the young experts dispersed with different expressions.

……

……

"So the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] and the [Dragon Fist] I’m cultivating, would have so many harmonizing aspects."

Ye Qingyu's consciousness travelled around.

Previously, when he had used the [Dragon Fist], he had aided [Shadow] in suppressing the abnormalities of falling into a state of demonic fire. In truth, at the beginning, Ye Qingyu had only wanted to use [Dragon Fist] like using a staff and use the [Supreme Ice Flame] in reality to suppress. The [Supreme Ice Flame] was said to be able to burn all materials, and it was also of the ice attribute. This was the most suppressive towards the abnormal power of demonic fire.

But Ye had not imagined that when he fought with [Shadow], thanks to the incitement of his [Shadow Sword Mantra], Ye Qingyu suddenly comprehended something about the [Dragon Fist]. A vigourous power involuntary exploded. Faintly, he could sense a deeper layer of power within the [Dragon Fist] mantra. Such an understanding fiercely erupted within his mind. He suddenly realized that the [Dragon Fist] could suppress such a state of demonic fire.

Such an enlightenment and comprehension towards the [Dragon Fist] exploded like a mountain landslide. It could not be stopped.

Ye Qingyu had a feeling that every fist he struck out increased his understanding towards the [Dragon Fist] marginally.

Without sensing it, at the later stages, he had already fallen into a strange state. Within his eyes, he could only see where the abnormal power gathered within [Shadow's] body. His body was extremely optimal, it was as if the nine moves of the [Dragon Fist] had become his inherent ability. It would not harm [Shadow's] body in the slightest, and would also shake away the evil power that occurred after falling into a state of demonic fire.

The nameless breathing technique, [Dragon Fist] mantra and added to that, the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].

When these three great cultivation techniques combined, there was mysterious change that occurred. Even Ye Qingyu himself was immersed in such a minute feeling.

He faintly felt, that the [Dragon Fist] mantra as well as the [True Will of the Sky Dragon], had a supplementary effect on each other.

Faintly, Ye Qingyu felt that the urge to activate the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] fully and transform, soaring in the skies. But he still kept his wits and suppressed such a feeling.

Dragonification.

This was one of Ye Qingyu's greatest trump cards, he did not want it to be exposed like so.

At this time, Ye Qingyu was already completely submerged into the essences of the [Dragon Fist] mantra as well as the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] colliding with each other. His entire person was like his soul had been ejected from his body. He could see this two groups of strange energy combining in front of his eyes. It was as if he could grab the divine light in front of him if he only extended his hands, but his hand could not be lifted, nor extended…

Time passed by just like that.

Ye Qingyu already did not know just how much time went by.

When the two strange light energies finally mixed together, its colour mottled, it suddenly charged towards him and entered his consciousness.

Ye Qingyu was greatly shocked, then suddenly opened his eyes.

……

……

"You little kid, just how long will you comprehend for?"

Bao Shinu rubbed his own head.

"He won't stay like that for his entire life will he?"

The battle technique instructor also felt a headache.

They had stood there for ten days and ten nights just like this, not moving in the slightest. If this continued on, they also did not know just how long they would stand for. It was rumoured that there were some divine people that, once they entered enlightenment, would not move for a hundred years. Their flesh would slowly wither, and their consciousness would also fade. Others would believe that they had already died, but after slumbering for a hundred years in their coffin, they would enter the Dao instantly and instantly become one of the Extreme level experts, recovering their vitality.

Ye Qingyu had already stood there and comprehended for ten days, without any signs of awakening. Twenty days had already passed of the one month training. If it was the end of one month and Ye Qingyu had not yet awakened, what should they do?

The two instructors rubbed their head, feeling a headache coming on.

They were still hesitant, whether they needed to report such a matter to the crown prince. Although the training camp was small, but this was something that the crown prince had personally made happen. If an accident happened...

The other young experts had already gradually gotten used to such a scene.

The two instructors were like mother hens looking after eggs, carefully guarding the [War God] on the arena. The young experts were looking on in amusement, and their gazes would occasionally turn to the [War God]. They would display expressions of envy. All martial artists would know just what the state the [War God] was in represented.

The black-robed young man, [Shadow], had also come to the arena. After looking on for a while, he returned to train.

After fighting the battle with the [War God], his strength had increased by leaps and bounds. The power of the [Shadow Sword Mantra] had already increased rapidly. After breaking past the bottleneck, his performance was terrifying. He sat stably on the number two position in the [Dragon Tiger List] without falling at all.

It was that his performance had become much more silent than before.

Previously, the person who would mock others and had a sharp tongue, who would fight with the other young experts over a small matter was not there anymore. The black-robed youth, [Shadow], had already not spoken for several days or fought with other people. If previously, [Shadow] was an unmatched sharp weapon that would glimmer even in darkness, right now he was an invisible blade that had hidden away all its light in darkness.

One must know that the crown prince had already made arrangements for all these people. This was a gravely important matter. If after a month had entered, the most important [War God] was still in such a state, then the problem would be large.

Many plans would have to be rearranged as a result of this.

Who knew just how long the [War God] would comprehend for.

If he was like the ancients that slumbered for a hundred years, even if when he awakened he would have incredible power, but at that time everything would be too late. Everything about the crown prince's plan would go to waste.

"Such a matter cannot be delayed any longer. We must report to his highness." Bao Shinu said with a worried face---

Chapter 358:


359 - Not the same

The battle technique instructor was about to speak out, when he suddenly sensed something. Turning back to the arena, he was taken aback. There was instantly a delighted glimmer that emitted from his eyes, "He's awakened, that little kid has awakened..."

Bao Shinu turned to look.

On the arena, the [War God] that had always been comprehending had suddenly opened his eyes. He looked at his surroundings in shock, his eyes as deep as the ocean. The aura he had was many times more stable and deep than previously. There was faint signs of an inner might that even Bao Shinu and the battle technique instructor could not help but feel a sense of apprehension at.

The two instructors gave each other a look, both able to see the delight and shock in each others eyes.

Without needing to ask, this time [War God] had stood there for ten days in comprehension, he must have obtained an unimaginable gain. Without any accidents, the current [War God] had already been reborn. Even the two instructors who had long been Bitter Sea stage experts, would not gain any advantage if they faced [War God] one on one.

He really was a monster.

"People, follow my orders. Quickly prepare Spirit qi food and drink as well as two pounds of Origin crystal. This is to be brought to the stone bed of [War God]." Bao Shinu laughed greatly.

This was the same as when [Shadow] had recuperated from his state of demonic fire. Standing there in comprehension would also greatly use up a martial experts spirit. Although it was not the loss of blood, but expenditure of one's spirit was even more serious.

The battle technique instructor jumped up to the arena, his expression concerned as he evaluated Ye Qingyu. Seeing that he was fine, he nodded his head in relief, "How are you feeling?"

He did not ask what Ye Qingyu had gained from his comprehension.

Because this was an extremely private question for a martial artist.

Ye Qingyu deeply breathed in, his expression finally calming down.

From the expression of the surrounding people, a long period of time should have passed while he was comprehending. And seeing the true worried expressions of the instructors, there was a faint sense of warmth in Ye Qingyu's heart.

"I feel great, thank you instructors."

Ye Qingyu respectfully paid his thanks.

"Haha, that's great, that's great. Me and old Wang were hesitating whether we needed to report this to the crown prince, but it seems there is no need now. You've stood here for ten days in total, this is really too shocking. I have already ordered others to lock down news of this, outsiders do not know of anything, you can rest assured." Bao Shinu laughed straightforwardly.

But Ye Qingyu could evidently hear that the attitudes of the two instructors had become much more intimate after his enlightenment. In the world of martial artist, strength was revered. Everything was decided by strength.

Below the arena.

The other seventeen experts also rushed here after hearing of such news.

Without knowing when, Ye Qingyu had already left a deep, unshakeable impression in these arrogant and unbridled young experts. At this time, even if someone had the will to challenge [War God] they would not have been as arrogant and willful as before.

This included the black-robed young man named [Shadow].

His expression was calm. He stood outside the crowd, silent and peaceful.

"Haha, [War God], you seemed to have awakened. I wanted to challenge you, but I already have waited till my hair turned white..."

Ye Qingyu smiled.

Ye Qingyu had a decent impression of this burly and bright young man.

"Good, I await your challenge." Ye Qingyu said.

"There's also me..." The lazy handsome youth with pale yellow hair also came over and said laughingly, "I've already completely comprehended my [Heart Shooting Projectile] mantra. I want to ask for some pointers from [War God]."

"Fine." Ye Qingyu nodded his head.

He faintly moved his body, and felt a series of numbness shooting through his body. The effects of body refinement was even greater. This should be the synergistic effect of comprehension of both the [Dragon Fist] and [True Will of the Sky Dragon]. He had further refined some of the chaotic power of lightning that was inserted into his body on that day during the palace of the [Formation Sovereign] that day.

The synergy between the [Dragon Fist] and [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was really too shocking.

Ye Qingyu had high expectations that when he activated the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] to its utmost and underwent dragonification, then used [Dragon Fist], just what would its might be.

Seeing the battle will burning in the eyes of [Avalanche], Ye Qingyu's heart faintly moved. "Since there's the will to do battle, why not have it right now instead of picking and choosing a date?"

The youth that was burly like a gorilla, [Avalanche], hesitated slightly, "Your condition..."

Ye Qingyu let out a self-confident smile, and made an inviting gesture. "It matters not."

“Good, the [War God] really is decisive." [Avalanche] grabbed at something through the air. A pair of gigantic purple gold meteor hammers landed in his hands. His figure quivered, and rose like a divine great mountain. The thunder and lightning in his hammers directly struck towards Ye Qingyu who was standing in the arena.

Bao Shinu and the battle technique instructor flashed. In a split second, they were already below the arena.

Ang!

The roar of the dragons sounded everywhere.

Ye Qingyu extended his hand, and the first technique of the [Dragon Fist] struck out.

Right now, the usage of [Dragon Fist] was incomparably smooth, the moves coming as easily as breathing, every single move like instinct. It was as if he had practice it thousands upon thousands of times. The remnants of the power of lightning ran throughout his body, bolts of lightning flickering, causing a strange sight.

Ye Qingyu could not help but let out a long roar.

He really felt indescribably carefree and uninhibited.

Boom!

Using his fists as a weapon, Ye Qingyu did not fall under any disadvantage whatsoever.

Huge booms emitted like divine thunder rumbling.

[Avalanche] was sent flying tens of meters high into the air. He could not help laughing in the air, "Hahaha, great, this is too great. There is finally someone who can match me in terms of power, and let me have an unrestrained battle. [War God] come, I am no longer the [Avalanche] ten days ago. Let me try out my [Rumbling Heaven Hammer] mantra, let's see how many of your moves I can withstand. “

In the air, the air currents surrounding the body of [Avalanche] began to curve around, his shocking aura beginning toexplode. His pair of gigantic hammers emitted a purple gold light, expanding in size by several times. Tight and clustered formation light encircled around the body of the hammer, as if a gigantic deity had descended.

Boom!

the strike of the hammer was like the rage of a deity.

"Come."

Ye Qingyu stood where he was, not moving or evading. His black hair danced in the air like a black flame. He fluctuated his qi as he took a stance. Accompanied by roars of dragons, the might of the [Dragon Fist] mantra was fully exhibited. He used his flesh and blood body to fight against the [Rumbling Heaven Hammer].

Boom Boom Boom Boom!

A series of metallic loud clashes caused everyone's ears to go numb. Even the light and barriers of space seem to have gone distorted. The scene in front of everyone seemed as if there was a severe earthquake.

If solely according to the strength, then the two persons on the arena were definitely the peak out of all the eighteen experts. There was no one else who could fight against them in terms of power. Even [Shadow] who had always been second in the [Dragon Tiger List] would not be able to do so.

Such a battle continued for an entire hour.

This whole process was like a copper man meeting a metal brush, with no one willing to give an inch. It was hard against firm. Whether it was the [War God] or [Avalanche], they did not use any techniques to divert force. Earth shattering loud booms began resounding madly throughout the entire training camp. If not for the fact that there was a formation sound barrier blocking the noise, the entire military department building would be able to hear such metallic clashes.

Ultimately, [Avalanche] was panting heavily, unable to wield his pair of hammers anymore.

Such a high intensity of clashes caused the rebound of the hammers to be unending. At the start it was not anything significant, but after an hour, his entire arm had gone numb.

Clang!

Throwing one of the Spirit weapon hammer to the ground, [Avalanche] panted heavily.

"Stop, stop stop. Phew, phew phew... It's so tiring, I've never been so fatigued. [War God], you win... you are... the first… person to force me to such an extent." He bent over, both hands on his kneecap. It was as if he was just pulled up from water, sweat falling like the rain around him as he panted.

A blood qi that was like an ocean began surging from the body of [Avalanche].

Evidently, after experiencing such a direct clash without any technique whatsoever, he had broken through a bottleneck. His level had been greatly raised, as if he had broken through an invisible barrier.

"Thank you. [War God], I will remember this favour."

As he panted, [Avalanche] picked up his pair of gigantic hammers and jumped down the arena.

Not only he, but the others could tell that the [War God] had always shown mercy from the very start. He had suppressed his strong form and used a similar of strength to fight with [Avalanche]. That was why the battle had continued for such a length of time, and allowed [Avalanche] to comprehend in such a unrestrained battle. His power grew explosively as a result of this.

If [War God] had struck with his full power, then the scene would be the same as ten days ago. [Avalanche] would still be struck off the arena in one strike.

Seeing the uninhibited scene of [Avalanche] breaking through his bottleneck, the other young experts also grew envious.

Ye Qingyu sweated heavily.

He had also gained significantly throughout this battle.

Through such a direct battle with the gorilla-like young man, [Avalanche], this was the best method to test the effect of Ye Qingyu's body refinement. Ten days ago, when he had finished his battle with [Shadow] he had let out a jet of black blood. In truth, this was because of the impurities caused by the [Dragon Fist] mantra in his organs, as it was not complete.Today he had borrowed the power of [Avalanche] to completely erase the inner problems of his body.

"Is there anyone else?"

Ye Qingyu extended his hand, and took the [Beheading Wind] sword that was stabbed into the arena into his hand. His will to battle faintly emitted.

"I’ll go!"

========================================

Chapter 359:


360 - Who wants to fight again?

This time, the person to jump onto the arena was [Flowing Light].

He was the lazy handsome youth with long pale yellow hair.

Ten days ago, the strength of [Flowing Light] could be compared to [Shadow]. But after the battle [Shadow] had with Ye Qingyu, not only did he erase the problem of falling into demonic fire, [Shadow's] strength had also entered into the next level. Ever since then, [Flowing Light] no longer had any method of fighting against [Shadow] on the [Dragon Tiger List] and had been forced into number three.

Seeing that [Avalanche] had also broken through his bottleneck after fighting with [War God], how could he not feel impatient?

[Flowing Light] was clear in his heart that although he had fought and killed countless times in the army, he had long reached his limits. He no longer had any way of raising his strength by killing and fighting with the army. Only fighting against true experts could he activate his potential and go on to the next level.

But to activate his hidden potential, he had to fight a top level expert. Where would he find one so easily?

The [War God] in front of him was unquestionably the most suitable person.

Therefore, after [Avalanche] left the arena, he instantly let out his challenge.

His figure flickering, [Flowing Light] landed on the arena.

"Please."

"Please.”

The two bowed to each other and the battle began at the next instant.

The martial style of [Flowing Light] was the same as his name. His greatest strength was in his speed. The instant he acted, his figure was like flowing light with multiple figures, and no way of discerning which was his true figure. It caused one to be unable to see what moves he used, and they had no way of figuring out just where he was.

With Ye Qingyu's vision, even he could only faintly see some shadows that flickered around him. He had no way of capturing his true body.

"No wonder he is called [Flowing Light]. His speed is definitely at its extreme. Although his cultivation state is only half a step into the Bitter Sea stage, but his speed is so quick that even a Bitter Sea stream stage expert would have no way of comparing to him. This person's speed has already reached its extreme.“

Ye Qingyu held the [Beheading Wind] sword, not moving in the slightest.

This time, the young experts the crown prince had chosen all had similar strength, but every one of them had an incomparable speciality. For example, [Shadow] was of the shadow attribute, [Avalanche] had divine strength and [Flowing Light] had the quickest speed. Others such as [Storm] and [Long River] must also have their specialities.

Since his eyes could not capture him, Ye Qingyu closed his eyes.

His consciousness spread out like the tide, encompassing everything in the arena, wanting to capture [Flowing Light]'s figure.

Xiu!

Accompanied by a sharp sound of something piercing through the air, a sharp feeling had already reached his face.

Ye Qingyu struck out with his sword, blocking it.

But [Beheading Wind] met with nothing.

After [Flowing Light] had calculated his strike would have no way of achieving his aim, he rapidly retreated. He struck then retreated in one smooth move, not leaving even a shadow behind. Ye Qingyu's block had no way of touching the [Heavenly Projectile] in his hands.

As his sword pierced air, Ye Qingyu's body once again stayed still.

[Flowing Light]'s figure, became even faster.

One was still while one was moving rapidly. This comparison was too acute.

For many of the young experts below the arena, the majority of them could only see [War God] standing there like a sculpture. A faint yellow gust enveloped around him, and there would occasionally be a silver projectile that pierced through the air. Only then would Ye Qingyu move his sword, but everytime his sword moved, it had no way of touching [Flowing Light's] true body.

"I really hate the method at which this person does battle. Soft and gentle, there's no way of striking him. Everytime I strike out, it is like hitting cotton floss or the air, this is enough to make me spit out blood!" [Avalanche] complained.

The other young experts also had a similar feeling.

In these past twenty days, there had been people who had sparred with [Flowing Light] so they understood.

The reason that [Shadow] was able to defeat [Flowing Light] was because [Shadow] was also of the speed attribute. Furthermore, [Shadow's] cultivation techniques were was substituting for histrue body, causing his true body to be unable to be discerned. This counteracted [Flowing Light's] extreme speed of doing battle.

At this time, many young experts focused their attention on the arena.

Everyone wanted to know if the [War God], who would unquestionably remain number one on the [Dragon Tiger List] no matter what the time, just whether he would be able to break through the extreme speed of [Flowing Light].

An hour very quickly passed just like that.

Under the surveillance of everyone, Ye Qingyu maintained his still form. His sword would strike out one by one, but he had never touched [Flowing Light]. Even the [Heavenly Projectile] in his hands, he had not been able to touch.

But the eyes of the two instructors and the other young experts grew brighter and brighter.

Because everyone could see that [Flowing Light]'s speed had evidently lowered

Such a lowering of speed did not mean that he lacked for stamina.

It was because there was a strange field that appeared on the arena some unknown time ago. It caused [Flowing Light] to be stuck like he was in quicksand, his movements began to be restricted.

At the same time when the [War God] struck out, the originally normal sword aura seemed to cause a strange sensation to be born in others. The sword that seemed to strike out without any guidance or movement seemed to have a profoundness of the Dao that was hard to describe using words.

Finally.

Ding!

A light sound.

The [Beheading Wind] sword finally touched the [Heavenly Projectile].

[Flowing Light's] weapon finally could not retreat at the first instance. The great sword in Ye Qingyu's hand finally made contact with it.

This was the first metallic clash that emitted since the battle begun.

It was weak.

But in the ears of everyone, it was even louder and more piercing than heavenly thunder.

The next instant, Ye Qingyu, who had closed his eyes and used his consciousness to capture [Flowing Light], finally opened his eyes. The [Beheading Wind] sword in his hand that was only used for blocking, suddenly struck explosively. In the time of a spark, it cut towards empty space by the side.

The instant the sword cut down, a faint figure appeared there.

"What?”

"He's been hit!"

"[War God] has already seen through the secrets behind the body technique of [Flowing Light]. He has struck with his sword prematurely through the trajectory that [Flowing Light] will definitely pass though, so it seemed like [Flowing Light] went and struck the greatsword of his own initiative.“

"The rhythm of [Flowing Light] has been disrupted."

"[War God] really is unbeatable. To think he would use such a method to defeat [Flowing Light's] speed."

"In truth, I feel that the true terrifying aspect of [War God] is not as such. In this entire hour, look at his movements. In truth, he has completely suppressed [Flowing Light's] speed. Every sword that Ye Qingyu struck out with, [Flowing Light] must make a response to. In truth, the person that was truly forced to respond was [Flowing Light]. Was there anyone who even saw [Flowing Light] even able to enter into a one inch area of [War God] after fighting for an entire hour?“

The young experts discussed the fight in low voices.

Compared to twenty days ago, everyone had become much more familiar with each other. They were all people with extraordinary talent, and their vision and judgment was extremely high. This series of discussions had penetrating insight.

As they spoke, everything on the arena had already changed.

The Ye Qingyu who was silent and did not move finally acted of his own initiative. His footsteps were slow, but every step he took, every sword strike he made, had an indescribableness about it. It was as if it had the power of foresight, that would strike the path that [Flowing Light] would definitely take.

An even quicker speed would not be faster than foresight.

This was an irrefutable truth.

The complexion of [Flowing Light] greatly changed.

The situation suddenly turned difficult.

He originally felt that he was an extremely nimble fish, swimming freely in the ocean. But the surrounding ocean had turned into sand. His advantage had disappeared.

[War God] struck sword after sword at him. The sword was not fast nor quick, but caused him to feel extremely pressed. His speed had no way of activating.

"Why is it like this?"

It seemed as if there was really flowing light in the brain of [Flowing Light]. He suddenly realized that the extreme speed that he had always pursued, when it reached a relative peak and he could not break through any further was not because this was the pinnacle of speed. It was because the meaning that he imposed on speed had always been too narrow and lacking from the beginning.

"I understand."

He loudly shouted, then retreated, suddenly stopping.

There was mad delight on his face, the two [Heavenly Projectile]-like silver sprites jumping and leaping naturally around in his palm. There was a mad joy in his eyes as he looked at Ye Qingyu, "I understand, hahahaha, I understand. Thank you, [War God]. I will definitely repay the favour today, wahahaha..."

Before he had finished.

He disappeared, returning to the dormitory to comprehend such a flash of insight.

Ye Qingyu stood on the arena, still wanting to go further.

With the [Beheading Wind] great sword in his hands, he had only begun to comprehend some of the mysteries behind the [Human King Sword Mantra]. He had used his most instinctive method to use the sword, to fight. It was only that the speed of [Flowing Light] had given him far too much pressure. Counterattacking under such pressure seemed to have really caused Ye Qingyu to have a flash of insight, interacting with a trace of meaning of the [Human King Sword Mantra].

It was a pity that [Flowing Light] had already admitted his loss and left the arena.

But a new opponent quickly came.

"[Storm], please."

The somewhat silent young man did not have a figure like [Avalanche], but he was also abnormally muscular. His muscles and skin were like boulders, filled with an explosive power that made one fear.

The battle begun once again.

Ye Qingyu once again immersed himself in comprehending the [Human King Sword Mantra].

Storm had exhibited his strongest power. The reason he was called [Storm] was because there was the bloodline of ancient berserks running through his body. He could go berserk in battle, instantly causing his offensive and defensive power to multiply, and losing the ability to feel pain. He lost all fear and hesitation and turned into an intricate machine to do battle.

But after an hour, he jumped off the arena of his own volition.

Coming out of the berserk state, [Storm] was fatigued, but his eyes burned like the stars.

This was the first time that he had forcefully been ejected from his berserk state before his time was up. This was the first time he could sense pressure and fear in his berserk state, and recovered a shred of his consciousness.

From the information that he received from his ancient blood, this was a very good sign. This represented an increase in the explosive power of his bloodline.

In reality, after [War God] battled with [Shadow], [Avalanche], [Flowing Light] and also [Storm], they all obtained a result they wanted.

Such a result caused other young experts to not be able to bear it any longer. They all challenged Ye Qingyu one by one.

Every young expert hoped to be able to break past their bottleneck from fighting [War God], to take the next step forward. This was even more attractive when all the cultivation techniques and resources were provided by the military department and Imperial family.

Chapter 360:


361 - The end of training

Bao Shinu and the battle technique instructor looked at each other. They did not move to halt such challenges.

If they were able to raise the battle power of all these young experts, then why should they stop it? For them, this was definitely a beneficial matter. They would definitely receive praise when they reported to the crown prince after the month's deadline. This meant that they had completed their training mission successfully.

On the arena.

Ye Qingyu had already defeated six opponents consecutively.

His entire person was already submerged into a strange Dao rhythm. Every time he struck with his sword, he would follow his heart. No matter whether it was an established sword move, or it was something he made up on the spot, or he would even occasionally use the moves from the [Fiendgod Titled hart]. There was no connection between his actions, he only followed his will.

The strength of these young experts were perfectly suitable for Ye Qingyu to train his sword.

They were after all top level experts at the Spirit spring stage or people with half a step into the Bitter Sea stage. They were at a level that was perfectly balanced; while they would give Ye Qingyu huge pressure, they would not make him use his full power to fight. Such a state was perfect for Ye Qingyu to comprehend while battling.

Furthermore, the technique that every young expert used was different and so were their martial styles. It gave Ye Qingyu many different inspirations.

As time flowed on, Ye Qingyu danced with his sword on the arena. There were young experts that constantly challenged him on the arena of their own initiative. They would fight, then be forced off the arena, then another would come up and challenge, then forced down again. Then more people would come...

Such a process did not need words.

This process of consecutive battles continued on for a day and a night.

For the cultivation of such young experts, such a level of battle could not be counted for much.

Everytime Ye Qingyu fought with a young expert, the young expert would comprehend something different.

Even if it was not possible for them to break through their own bottleneck right there, but they would be able to find the direction as to how to break through their bottleneck.

Because the [War God] possessed a different strange power. After fighting for a short period of time, he would very quickly discover the weakness of the opponent and target such a weak point. It completely suppressed the opponent.

In a situation where their weaknesses were constantly targeted, they naturally learnt and gained much with the talent of these young experts.

Ultimately, all of the seventeen young experts, apart from [Shadow] and [Normal Person] had all fought a round with Ye Qingyu. The first thing every one of them did after they were forced off the arena was sit down and meditate. They wanted to comprehend their gains as soon as possible. There were constantly people breaking past their limits.

What followed after was another day and night of battles.

After awakening from their comprehension, they would instantly fight to go on to the arena after they saw that [War God] was still standing on the arena. They wanted to challenge him again. They wanted to confirm the results of their comprehension and had high expectations that the [War God] could help them break through yet again.

For these young experts, such an opportunity was really truly rare.

Even the best master could not teach them through such a method, to help them find the weakness in their martial path and perfect their martial path.

For Ye Qingyu, this was a perfect training experience.

Constantly fighting, unending battles.

In the process of fighting, his focus gradually shifted away from the battle and his opponent. In his brain, he focused on the description of the Sword Dao in the [Human King Sword Mantra], especially the introduction of the sword mantra to the Sword Dao. Every character was like a flash of insight that would fly about in his mind, then combine again, and then evolve. What followed after was incomprehensibly lengthy theories.

Ye Qingyu's thoughts had already completely submerged into the [Human King Sword Mantra].

His body still continued battling instinctively with the young experts on the arena.

His will and spirit continued on in a state where his consciousness had nearly left his body.

This entire forty-eight hours of battle was just like an instant for him in his consciousness.

The tens of thousands of letters in the [Human King Sword Mantra], transformed into light that danced within Ye Qingyu's brain. It reordered itself, as if new mysteries were being born. Insights that were born and died like shooting stars constantly appeared and disappeared. Ye Qingyu madly did his utmost to capture that instant that seemed incomparably far away...

It was unknown just how long time had passed.

Boom!

All the letters and light had disappeared from his brain.

Quiet, peace and clarity came.

Ye Qingyu's consciousness once again returned to his body. Everything in his vision became clearer.

He discover he was standing with his sword.

There was no longer any opponent on the arena.

Below the arena, all the young experts were staring at him with shock.

The sword was in his hands, but it was like the sword was not in his hands.

The sword was in his hands, but it was like the sword was in his heart.

With the sword in the hand, there was a great sensation that was born. It was as if he only needed to strike with his sword, and he could cut apart anything in the world.

“This... this is what the [Human King Sword Mantra] described as the sensation of early success, could it be... I unintentionally interacted with the true essences of the [Human King Sword Mantra]?"

Ye Qingyu held the [Beheading Wind] great sword in his hand. His heart was both shocked and delighted.

The long sword faintly moved.

His entire person was filled with an extremely comfortable feeling. It was as if there was nothing at all that would be able to block his sword. No matter who or what it was in front of him, he could split it into two.

Looking below the arena.

One could see a clear sword wound on the clothes of [Avalanche], cutting apart his clothes. There was a faint white scar left on the [Thundering Heaven Hammers]. A trace of blood was on the left side of his chest as well as his right abdomen, that was faintly able to be seen like a red line.

"Brother [War God], you're strikes are really vicious. If not for the fact that I was able to sense danger and jumped down the arena to admit defeat, your sword might have already taken my life. I would have turned into a corpse split in half on the arena..." Even if [Avalanche] was courageous, his expression was still shaky.

He was the last person who jumped to the arena to challenge Ye Qingyu.

Originally, everything was the same as before. [Avalanche] constantly trained and comprehended his own martial path in battle, and Ye Qingyu gave him suitable pressure. It was like the pressure of a mountain or the sea, it was just perfect. But just when he was about to be forced out of the arena, Ye Qingyu's aura suddenly changed. It was not as gentle and as calm as before, and a sharp, piercing sword will that was incomparably sharp descended like ten thousand swords. It was only a casual strike, yet [Avalanche] felt like he was a pig about to be beheaded. He had no way of blocking such a true sword strike.

At the crucial moment, he immediately jumped down the arena. He also activated the [Thundering Heaven Hammers] to its extreme and blocked such a sword in mid air.

Even if he did so, he was still hurt.

There was even a scar left on the [Thundering Heaven Hammers] that was of the Spirit class. It needed the nourishment in his Spirit springs for at least a month or two before it could recover.

For [Avalanche], such a sword strike was equal to him running between the line of life and death,

Ye Qingyu was faintly taken aback, and finally understood the reason.

When he had succeeded in reaching the early stages of the [Human King Sword Mantra], he could not control its power perfectly and had mistakenly injured the muscular young man.

He was about to clasp his hands in apology, when [Avalanche] began chuckling. "Congratulations in reaching a whole new level, [War God]. I know that you did not mean to." As he said that, he gave a wink.

……

……

The next ten days was the last ten days of the month.

Apart from training in the nameless breathing technique every day, the large majority of Ye Qingyu's time was spent immersing himself in the [Dragon Fist] as well as the [Human King Sword Mantra]. Such a training process was naturally on the arena. It was constant refinement through fighting different young experts.

Because Ye Qingyu had helped everyone apart from [Normal Person], everyone, no matter whether they were proud or arrogant or not, would be exceedingly respectful towards Ye Qingyu. Their attitude had grown much more mild. Faintly, the title that Ye Qingyu had, [War God], became true. Not only was his strength the best of the crowd, he also became the leader of the group, with the most authority and charisma.

In the last three days, there was no way Ye Qingyu could use the [Human King Sword Mantra] to fight with the others.

Because there was no longer anyone who could even withstand three moves of the [Human King Sword Mantra].

This had also indirectly proven the words of Dugu Quan. The three great sword mantras were really peerless techniques. It was many times more profound than the secret martial mantras obtained by the other young experts. This made Ye Qingyu faintly feel that he must have been given special treatment?

As for the [Dragon Fist] mantra, Ye Qingyu had already completely grasped it at a pinnacle level.

Under the activation of the nameless breathing technique, the [Dragon Fist] in Ye Qingyu's hands were even more powerful than the two instructors. It was only that he did not demonstrate this fact very often. In the entire training camp, including the two main instructors, there was no longer anyone that was Ye Qingyu's opponent. Therefore, Ye Qingyu began to conceal his true strength.

Of the seventeen other young experts, only [Shadow] ever since he had gotten rid of his psychological shadow, did not challenge Ye Qingyu again.

The [Normal Person] who was ranked last, had never challenged Ye Qingyu from beginning till end for some reason. But his attitude towards Ye Qingyu was also exceedingly respectful and admiring.

Today was the last day of the month.

During the evening, the body refinement instructor Bao Shinu announced that the closed isolation training of a month had finished. That night, they allowed the young experts to leave the building of the military department, and no longer restricted the movements of the group. They only needed to return to the 55th floor of the military building before noon the second day. They would announce and allocate the missions and duties for everyone then.

Such a result, made Ye Qingyu feel slightly surprised.

At the very beginning, he had guessed that gathering the eighteen persons here for training and cultivation in isolation, there was a great chance there was a top secret operation of the military, or perhaps some other significant matter. But from the tone of Bao Shinu, it seemed to be just a normal training, and there was not any special training that awaited the eighteen people.

After releasing the seal, the training of the young experts could be said to have ended.

Under the proposal of one person, the eighteen people decided to go out and relax. After being cooped up for a month, everyone wanted to go out and breathe some fresh hair. After a month's contact, everyone was already familiar with each other, so no one went alone. The eighteen went as a group.

Ye Qingyu knew instantly that the relaxing in their words meant they were about to go to a brothel.

He originally did not want to go, but the group passionately invited him. He was the person with the greatest authority, so if he did not go, it would spoil the fun of the others. Ultimately, he agreed to go along, and even the most solitary black-robed young man, [Shadow] agreed to accompany them.

After briefly taking care of their luggage, the crowd left excitedly-----
