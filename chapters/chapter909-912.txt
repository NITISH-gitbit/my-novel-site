Chapter 909:


Chapter 926, The sword will from the Heavenly deities



Huang Shi thought to herself.

At this moment, there were already burst of cheers in Matchless Blade City. All of the disciples of Matchless Blade City were trembling excitedly, the entire city had sunk into a crazy atmosphere. The people living in Matchless Blade City all saw the city as home and Qin Zhishui as God, and thus his powerful counterattack had ignited the blood of every citizen.

Qin Zhishui saluted the cheering crowd with a cupped fist, then turned into a stream of light, returning to Matchless Blade City residence.

“Thank you, brother Ye Qingyu,” Qin Zhishui said, and was about to give his thanks by bowing.

Ye Qingyu grasped his arm with a smile, “You and I are brothers, why say thank you, there is no need to be so polite. Let alone this is what I should do. It is because I came so late that brother Qin Zhishui got wounded and many martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain had died. If my guess is right, then Wen Fusheng's reason of doing this is because of me.”

The higher-ups of Matchless Blade City also came over to express their thanks.

Huang Shi also bowed respectfully, “Thank you for lending a hand, Matchless Blade City will not forget your kindness.”

“Sister-in-law is too polite.” Ye Qingyu returned the bow.

Qin Zhishui and him were like-minded, addressed each others as brothers, and Qin Zhishui was a few years older than Ye Qingyu, so it was right that he called her sister-in-law.

But when the experts of Matchless Blade City looked at Huang Shi again, the expression in their eyes had changed again. Previously when Qin Zhishui was seriously wounded, Matchless Blade City felt that once Qin Zhishui had died, logically speaking the Supreme Elder should be the one who would take over the city until Huang Shi gives birth to the child, and then that child would succeed to the throne. But Huang Shi was born from an ordinary background, not a martial arts family, nor an official family. She was just a girl from a small remote mountain village, but Qin Zhishui fell in love with the peasant woman and willfully married to her. Once Qin Zhishui had died, his prestige scattered. Then Huang Shi’s ending, although it would be better than that of Qin Hui of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, in that her life would not be in danger, but the position of City Lord would not fall onto Huang Shi's child.

But now, since Ye Qingyu had called her sister-in-law, in the future even if Qin Zhishui really died, then nobody in Matchless Blade City would dare to do anything to Huang Shi and her child.

In Heaven Wasteland Domain, within the empire, how many could make the invincible Palace Lord Ye Qingyu bow?

Every word and action of an important person was mysterious. If anyone naively thought this was just a polite way to address her, then their brain had really rusted.

Soon, the experts, who came to watch the battle also came to Matchless Blade City residence to see Ye Qingyu.

Although these people did not turn things around in the battle, it was undeniable that they were the tower of strength of the martial arts world of Heaven Wasteland Domain, the backbone of its martial arts, and famous experts who had made a name for themselves long ago. They all had a great influence in the martial arts world of Heaven Wasteland Domain, thus Matchless Blade City also dared not treat them with disrespect, and then came to ask Ye Qingyu if he wanted to see these people.

“Of course, the martial artists who could appear in Matchless Blade City today are all heroes of Heaven Wasteland Domain.”

Ye Qingyu smiled.

There was suddenly a burst of cheers outside Matchless Blade City residence.

What an honour would it be for martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain to meet the Lord of the Light Palace in person and have a glass of wine together?

They did not expect to have this opportunity today. Everyone was incredibly excited, even the venerable elders who rarely smiled or spoke were as excited as a child. While the young and vigorous young martial artists could not help but start dreaming that the Palace Lord may see potential in them and take them in as disciples.

The efficiency of Matchless Blade City was very high.

In less than an hour, the banquet was already arranged.

Because there were far too many guests, the location of the banquet had to be outdoors. The guests were served food as they arrived. From the main hall of Matchless Blade City residence to the main street outside there was estimated to be tens of thousands of experts attending this banquet. Matchless Blade City welcomed everybody.

The wine and food on the table were all delicacies.

The young disciples of Matchless Blade City moved back and forth between the tables, serving up century-old spirit wine that even the core disciples of Matchless Blade City rarely drank a few sips of in one month. The dishes that were served were also cooked by the best chefs in the residence and prepared with the best ingredients, or were directly ordered from the most famous restaurants of Matchless Blade City, and delivered over at the fastest speed.

In the past few years, Matchless Blade City had become the leader of the Heaven Wasteland martial world, incomparably bustling, and was second only to Snow capital. Therefore, the major restaurants in the city could also be said to be renowned in the empire. Ordinary martial artists that did not have a certain power and wealth would not eat or drink at these major restaurants.

It was no exaggeration to say that this time, Matchless Blade City really showed absolute sincerity, and had spent a large amount of money.

In fact, in addition to the officials of Heaven Wasteland Domain, only Matchless Blade City could support such a grand banquet in such a short period of time.

This clearly showed that the power and wealth of Matchless Blade City had increased dramatically in these three or four years of time. Moreover, this time it was the strongest and most respected Lord of the Light Palace who borrowed the place to hold a banquet and more than three quarters of the martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain were in attendance. Thus Matchless Blade City naturally was incredibly generous. This scale was comparable to a Heaven Wasteland Domain martial arts meeting.

And the core of this banquet was undoubtedly Ye Qingyu and Qin Zhishui.

When Ye Qingyu appeared, all of the people at the banquet were stirred up. First there were cheers and cries of joy at the small square in front of the main hall, and then like a wave, the cheers spread far to the inside of the Matchless Blade City residence. The martial artists who could not see Ye Qingyu also knew what was happening, and were all stirred up.

And Ye Qingyu also did not break his promise, carrying a barrel of wine in one hand and a glass in the other, he, accompanied by Qin Zhishui and other people, toasted everyone starting from the small square outside the main hall to the streets outside. Regardless of strength, there was no difference in treatment. Such a gesture made the already excited martial artists completely plunged into high spirits. The atmosphere outside and inside was incredibly joyous and the mood was buoyant.

The martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain came to know a Ye Qingyu who was not the same as they had thought, and who was not the same as rumoured.

Ye Qingyu was said to be like a divine dragon from the Ninth Heaven, incomparably imposing and majestic. For many martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain he was a mysterious deity-like existence, but tonight the Ye Qingyu who appeared before them, although extraordinary handsome and graceful, there wasn't that distant majesty. On the contrary, he was like a hero of Jianghu, gulping down large bowls of wine and taking large bites of food. He seemed like an old friend, which instantly closed the distance between them.

“From tomorrow, I will be in Matchless Blade City, speaking about martial arts for three days, and then I will build an incomparable arsenal, where I will leave behind some ancient books and manuals. Any person who has contributed to Heaven Wasteland Domain can enter the arsenal to have a look through, regardless of race or age!” Ye Qingyu said towards the end of the banquet.

The martial artists were all shaken.

The strongest person was going to speak about martial arts. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and there was going to be an arsenal of manuals. Given the strength of Palace Lord Ye Qingyu, the ancient books and manuals he had must be extraordinary. Moreover, anybody who had contributed to Heaven Wasteland Domain was allowed to have a look. This, for many experts without a strong enough foundation or had not received cultivation from a sect, was simply as good as a meat pie falling from the sky.

It was night and the entire Matchless Blade City was having a joyous time.

At the same time, everything that had happened in Matchless Blade City spread out at a terrifying speed.

……

The banquet came to an end.

Ye Qingyu stayed at Matchless Blade City residence that night.

Qin Zhishui reminisced with Ye Qingyu until dawn. During the day Ye Qingyu had treated Qin Zhishui's internal wound, and completely restored his former cultivation base. While they were chatting Ye Qingyu chose a cultivation manual called [The Sword Will from the Heavenly Deities] from the hundreds of cultivation manuals in the [Infinite Arsenal] for Qin Zhishui.

This cultivation technique was particularly suitable for those who practiced the sword, and once one reached the peak one would achieve the Great Saint realm. Among the hundreds of cultivation manuals in the [Infinite Arsenal] it was a superior cultivation technique and complemented well with the blade methods and skills of Matchless Blade City. Ye Qingyu had long prepared this for Qin Zhishui.

“Haha, with this cultivation technique I can soar to the sky and in the future may have the opportunity to fight alongside brother Ye Qingyu,” Qin Zhishui exclaimed.

Thinking to back then, his strength was comparable to Ye Qingyu, and he had fought alongside Ye Qingyu in the suspected palace of the Formation Emperor Luosu and coordinated well with him in the Battle of Light City. Although Qin Zhishui had not said this out loud, he had set his goal to be able to fight alongside Ye Qingyu. Thus, over the past few years he had been cultivating painstakingly to achieve the strength he had today. In Heaven Wasteland Domain, he was considered as one of the top existences, but after fighting against Wen Fusheng he came to realize that the difference in strength between Ye Qingyu and him was already too great.

This feeling was very difficult to bear for Qin Zhishui. He hoped that he could help Ye Qingyu, rather than always letting Ye Qingyu help him.

Chapter 910:


Chapter 927 – The Empress Leaves the Pass


On the second day.

The sun had just risen into the sky, giving off a fine shine.

Standing on the central square of Matchless Blade City, Ye Qingyu began to talk about martial arts.

Without even mentioning his present Saint cultivation and Great Saint battle strength, his path of cultivation alone was full of diverse learnings. Furthermore, he had experienced things which nobody from the Heaven Wasteland Domain had ever seen before, and had fought against experts from other domains in countless battles of various scales without being defeated even once. As a result, his horizons and knowledge, as well as his understanding of the martial path, could be said to surpass those of an entire martial generation of the Heaven Wasteland Domain, and therefore, as he began to talk, he was able to explain profound ideas in simple language without end. In the ears of many martialists, his words sounded like the music of the Great Dao, enlightening them almost at once and making them feel like they were becoming Immortals.

His voice diffused throughout the entire square.

As time passed, more and more people gathered on the square.

News of Lord Ye Qingyu’s martial arts lecture had spread since the previous night, such that by early morning on this day, many people knew of it and, without exception, immediately flocked to Matchless Blade City while quietly regretting only that they did not come sooner, or otherwise they could have made full use of this opportunity rather than missing out on a portion of it as they did by arriving only at this time.

Ye Qingyu had no intention of waiting for latecomers. He lectured until noon, when he announced a temporary break and turned to leave.

Many people on the square remained as if inebriated by what they had listened to, while even more people went into a meditative trance akin to a state of enlightenment in which they became oblivious to everything around them, completely immersed in an introspection of their own martial path and learnings...

Four hours later.

Ye Qingyu reappeared and resumed his martial lecture.

When dusk arrived, he stood up and left once more.

Under the moonlight, countless figures continued to sit quietly on the square, motionless. Although some were truly gaining enlightenment, others whose enlightenments were shallow simply did not dare to move for fear that they would not be able to get back a seat on the square in the next few days if they stood up and left. By this time, the square had become so overcrowded that there was not even a gap to stick a needle in.

“I’ve got it, haha, I’ve got it.” A young man in his twenties suddenly exclaimed wildly in pleasant surprise. After listening to sutras for a day, he had completely smashed through the martial path shackles which had troubled him for a long time. Silently, he had broken through to the pinnacle of the Heaven Ascension realm, and only now realized this. For some time, he could not control his emotions, and danced wildly in deviation from his usual self.

“Silence!” a supreme martial expert berated.

There was an inexplicable majesty in his voice.

Given that a significant number of people on the square had gained a breakthrough after listening to the sutras, there would be absolute chaos if every one of them danced unbridledly in joy, while lifelong hatreds would form if they disturbed the enlightenment states of others. Hence, they had to restrain themselves if they did not want to become public enemies.

The young man froze for a moment before he hurriedly restrained himself and dared not say anything further.

He was also a person of understanding.

Similar events happened on similar-sized squares in many different places.

Ye Qingyu’s comprehension of the martial path was so deep that the saintly lectures he gave could be said to be historic in the Heaven Wasteland Domain. The content of his lectures was applicable to all, whether one was a Spirit Spring stage warrior or an Immortal Step realm ace. Even the Heaven Wasteland’s martial veterans benefited greatly, while those warriors who had been doubtful of this Heaven Wasteland martial champion swiftly realized that Ye Qingyu’s martial cultivation and comprehension surpassed theirs completely, to the extent that they would never ever be able to catch up with him.

The number of people on the square increased with every passing moment, and eventually, there was absolutely no more sitting space. Many people were thus forced to sit on the surrounding stone walls and constructions.

Even mid-air was sat full of people.

Many experts who arrived late and did not get to listen to the first day of lectures were steeped in regret.

“Sigh, why didn’t Lord Ye Qingyu delay his lectures by a few days?” A travel-worn warrior said with a little regret, “After all, there are still many people who aren’t able to get here soon enough. Wouldn’t it have been better if he gave a notice three days before he began his lectures, so that more warriors could get here and listen to them?”

He was rebuked disdainfully as soon as he spoke, “Lord Ye Qingyu’s lectures are meant to repay those good men who strove to save Matchless Blade City from danger, not folks like you who rushed here upon hearing of this opportunity. You’re just basking in reflected glory, yet you aren’t content enough to have such an incredible opportunity to listen to his lectures. How dare you be judgmental of him, you must really know no shame!”

“That’s right. I’ve never seen such a shameless person before,” someone added.

The warrior who had been grumbling became red-faced at once. He wanted to justify himself a bit, but when he saw the angry expressions on the faces looking at him, he dared not say anything else and hurriedly lowered his head in search of a place to sit down.

During the time when he was not giving a lecture, Ye Qingyu was not idling either.

Over a past period of time, there were an extremely large number of Heaven Wasteland warriors who had been injured at Wen Fusheng’s hands. Using the power of the Matchless Blade Office, Ye Qingyu located these people and personally treated their injuries. Wen Fusheng’s martial techniques belonged to a foreign sect, and thus there were very few people who could treat those he injured. In fact, many warriors had no chance of recovery throughout their lifetimes, and were even at risk of dying in torment. Ye Qingyu certainly would not allow these warm-blooded martial artists who had defended the glory of the Heaven Wasteland Domain to suffer such a miserable end. Therefore, while treating their injuries one after another, he also helped them to advance their cultivation as a form of repayment.

In his view, these injured people were the truly respectable martial forces of the Heaven Wasteland Domain and were truly warm-blooded men, and that was why they deserved the most generous rewards. The people who came to Matchless Blade City but did not take any action were secondary in his considerations, while those who dared not even come were the last of his considerations. Hence, his primary purpose for staying in Matchless Blade City over these few days was for the sake of these injured people, while his lectures and the establishment of Matchless Arsenal were but spur-of-the-moment ideas. Ultimately, his actions were intended to beef up the martial strength of the Heaven Wasteland Domain to the greatest extent he could manage.

Three days later.

News arrived from the imperial city that Empress Yu Xiaoxing had left the pass.

After he concluded his final lecture, Ye Qingyu left behind in Matchless Blade City a few medicines and herbs to be used for the subsequent treatment of the injured people. He then designated a ten-story stone building prepared by Qin Zhishui as the base of Matchless Arsenal, for which he personally set up a few arrays and picked a few martial path secret books to be stored within to serve as its foundational heritage. He also entrusted the secret key for activating the arrays to Qin Zhishui.

After he did all this, he stood up and took his leave.

The square on which he gave his lectures remained packed full of people.

Greatly enlightened by the lectures, many people remained sitting still for several years and even centuries. In what could be called a miracle, they gained Dao and their strength grew by leaps and bounds as soon as they regained consciousness.

As a result of Ye Qingyu’s lectures here, this square would forever be remembered by posterity, becoming a holy ground for successive generations of Heaven Wasteland martialists.

Also, because of the battle that took place here, Matchless Blade City’s fame skyrocketed among the Heaven Wasteland Domain, such that it became the undisputed number one sect of the domain. Allegedly, Wu Shanglong, the Tiger Saint child of the Dragon Tiger Sect, was infinitely moved after the fact. “From this day onward, the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s Three Sects and Three Schools are history. We’ve officially entered an age in which one city reigns supreme. It will never again be possible for any sect or school to surpass Matchless Blade City...”

In the Snow capital.

In the Governance Hall of the imperial palace.

Ye Qingyu met Yu Xiaoxing.

Having cultivated in self-isolation, her countenance was clearly a lot ruddier than before. Complemented by her empress robes and crown, her originally-already delicate and beautiful looks became even more peerlessly charming, with a few added touches of heroic spirit. At first glance, she resembled a legendary goddess who caused one’s heart to palpitate and also rendered one unable to refrain from submitting and worshipping her.

“Cousin, I heard that you’ve been drinking in Matchless Blade City, is that so?” After dismissing her bodyguards and servants, Yu Xiaoxing dropped her empress bearing and grinned.

Ye Qingyu laughed, “The martial world is different from an imperial palace. When I’m entertaining important officials from an empire, just a few drinks would do. However, when associating with martial artists, I have to drink heavily and talk about a broad range of things so as to truly fit in. The matter of Wen Fusheng has reminded us that, now that the Domain Gate has been fully opened, not only will the empire face a huge test but all forces within the domain may also be reshuffled as a result. In particular, the Heaven Wasteland martial world will soon face considerable challenge and pressure from foreign martial artists. The martial path is upheld within the Vast Thousand Domains, while according to the laws of the jungle, the strong reigns supreme. The development of the empire’s military strength naturally cannot slacken, yet support and guidance for the Heaven Wasteland martial world remains an urgent priority.”

After she finished listening, Yu Xiaoxing grinned and responded, “Cousin, I’ll take your word for it. I’ll get Lin Zheng to assign people to get started on this matter.”

There was not a single trace of an empress’ stateliness and decisiveness in her tone.

Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.

He knew about her affection for him. Normally, in front of outsiders, she would act peerlessly dignified and carry an imperial vigor, such that when the old ministers such as Lin Zheng were facing her, they would tremble with fear and not dare to be shabby in any way. Throughout the entire dynasty, everyone held her in awe and veneration. It was only in front of him that she would drop her empress vigor and become akin to an innocent and unaffected young girl. To this, he did not know whether to shake his head or to laugh.

However, from a different perspective, this was a good thing.

Regardless of her present status and the responsibilities she bore on her shoulders, she was after all still a young girl who was at her most brilliant age. It was a good thing that there was someone who could allow her to take off the mask she wore regularly and relax for a bit. At the moment, he was clearly the most suitable person for this.

Therefore, he did not bring up any more political matters with her - in reality, he was never really interested in these things anyway. After chatting for an hour or so, Yu Xiaoxing suddenly sprang up and led him to the back garden.

========================================

Chapter 911:


Chapter 928 – Recasting the Blood Drinker Sword
After mysteriously getting Ye Qingyu to wait, the empress went in high spirits to change into a white-colored palace long dress. When she returned, she was holding a small sword in her hand. Her hairstyle had changed, with her jet-black long hair draped over her shoulders to her back waist, as dazzlingly beautiful as a waterfall. She had a completely different demeanor about her, resembling a fairy among a bed of flowers. With blooming dimples, she said, “Cousin, I created my own sword technique, and would like you, as the martial champion of the Heaven Wasteland Domain, to advise me on it.”
“A self-created sword technique? Hoho, I’ll indeed like to see what you’ve come up with. Haha, go ahead.” Ye Qingyu laughed as he leaned back against the railings and white marble steps beside a pavilion.
Given her status, she was able to obtain the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s highest level secret books on sword techniques just by asking. Earlier on, it was also her who gave Ye Qingyu the [War God Sword Mantras]. There was thus absolutely no need for her to create her own sword technique. Ye Qingyu figured that this was probably just a young girl’s whimsical plaything, and so he could go easy on it.
“This sword technique of mine is called [Young Xiaoxing of the Fast-Aging Heaven Wasteland].” With that, her small sword shook and began to dance lightly.
A tinge of surprise emerged on Ye Qingyu’s face when he heard this name.
‘The fast-aging Heaven Wasteland’!
‘Young Xiaoxing’.
For a time, he was a little dazed as he watched her sword-dancing among the flowers, resembling a lively flower fairy.
This so-called self-created sword technique of hers could only be considered a sword dance. Although it was magnificent and fascinating to an extreme, it did not have the slightest of killing power. Nevertheless, her purpose for this sword technique was apparently not to kill enemies anyway. Instead, it was simply intended as a light sword dance to be performed in front of someone she loved. Complemented by the flowers in the garden, her absolutely beautiful looks appeared noble, holy, and pure. Her poses were delicate and as light as those of a fairy, as if she was completely untainted by the dirt of the human world. This was a sight so beautiful that it was enchanting.
As an empress sword-dances among the flowers, who can read her little girl heart?
Ye Qingyu stood quietly where he was, his thoughts somewhat confused as he poetized. He didn't even realize when Yu Xiaoxing ended her dance, remaining dull and unresponsive.
“Cousin, brother Qingyu?” The young girl waved her small, fair-complexioned hand in front of him and waggishly snapped him out of his dazed state. A hint of delight flashed across her crescent-moon-like, squinting eyes as she asked, “Cousin, please give me some advice. How would you rate the power of my [Young Xiaoxing of the Fast-Aging Heaven Wasteland] sword technique?”
After glimpsing at her, he said with a smile, “It’s very powerful, and points directly at one’s heart.”
“Are you serious?” Yu Xiaoxing leaped in excitement as she smiled artfully and prettily while revealing her flowery dimples. “I know you’re lying, but I’m still happy enough… However, you shouldn’t be like this, cousin. At present, people inside and outside the palace are trying to figure out my thoughts and are telling what they think I want to hear. You mustn’t deceive me like them.”
Ye Qingyu replied, “Isn’t it good that people are telling you what you want to hear? If you ever get tired of that, you can just find a few pedantic and blunt ministers to tell you the truth.”
Yu Xiaoxing stuck her tongue out, “I’d rather not meet them, for I would get a headache every time I do. Sigh, being an empress is so tiring.”
Ye Qingyu could not help bursting into laughter, “You should be content. Among the Vast Thousand Domains, an emperor like you who can self-isolate whenever in a bad mood, yet can maintain the throne so steadily, would consider themself lucky already.”
“But I don’t like it.” Yu Xiaoxing sighed exaggeratedly.
It was already dusk by the time Ye Qingyu returned to Light City.
After summoning Gao Han, Li Changkong, and Wang Lijin, and with Ximen Yeshui and Wen Wan coincidentally around as well, he brought up the matter of building the Light Arsenal. Halfway through, Mother Wu personally brought over the dinner she had prepared.
“Let’s eat together.” Having not tasted Mother Wu’s dishes for a long time, Ye Qingyu somewhat missed them and thus became excited. This woman, who had followed him from Youyan Pass all the way to Light City, could by now be considered an elderly person of the city. Although she did not have an actual job, she had a son and a daughter serving as Ye Qingyu’s disciples, and so she was given an extremely special and highly-respected status in Light City. Ye Qingyu was reminded of Li Ying, Li Qi, and Bai Yuanxing when he saw her.
Pinching his fingers, he calculated that it had been a year since he sent these three disciples together with one hundred extremely talented children to the Clear River Domain. Although there had been constant communication with the Immortal God Emperor Sect and he thus knew that their cultivation was progressing well, he could not help feeling that it was time to pay them a visit.
He decided to take some time out to go on a trip to the Clear River Domain. Aside from visiting Bai Yuanxing and the others, he also wanted to visit Hu Bugui, Nan Tieyi, Liu Shaji, and some other old acquaintances. It had also been a long time since he met the couple of Ling Xiaoran and Heng Yuge, Chen Zhengliang, and others in Flowing Light City.
Mother Wu cleared the table after dinner was over.
Still holding an unfinished bowl of noodles, Wen Wan said, “My Lord, Ximen Yeshui and I plan to travel to many different domains so as to get to know more about their unique characteristics. We hope that you’ll give us your approval.”
The dark-faced scholar, Ximen Yeshui, also said grinningly, “Indeed, brother. Since the few of us won’t be able to help even if we remain in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, we might as well go explore a couple of new domains. My martial cultivation has reached a bottleneck which I haven’t been able to break through all this time. Perhaps, by chilling out for a bit, I might suddenly gain Dao, hehe!”
Ye Qingyu thought it over and agreed with what they said. Aside from fighting, this bunch was not reliable at doing anything else and would only spoil things. With his promotion to become the third deputy of the Human Race, the situation of the Heaven Wasteland Domain had stabilized for the time being, and thus there was no need for this bunch for the foreseeable future. Perhaps it would be a good thing to let them travel to foreign domains, which the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s current understanding of was limited to the superficial knowledge written about in books and records that could only be verified by letting people go out and explore.
“Yes, I shall approve, but I have two requests. First, you may only depart after the construction of the Light Arsenal is complete. Second, you must first go to the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain to find Luo Yi and help him settle the matter there before proceeding to other domains.” Ye Qingyu stuck two thumbs up and nodded in approval.
It had been more than two months since he left the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain. He figured that Qin Hui and Luo Yi should by now have more or less settled the internal issues of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect and tied up any loose ends. At this time, it should be possible to open a Domain Gate between the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect and the Heaven Wasteland Domain, and officially begin communication and coordination.
“No problem at all.” Ximen Yeshui cheerfully agreed.
“No problem, no problem at all, no problem...” The steel parrot on his shoulder mimicked.
This matter was agreed just like this.
Everyone departed after dinner.
Ye Qingyu dove once more into the Underground Fire Spirit Spring Sword Pit.
He did not enter the small plane hidden within the pit, and instead simply stood in the air above the underground magma river. The underground fire in this pit was slightly milder in temperature than that of the orange underground fire expanse in the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, and was suitable for refining weapons. On the first day of his return to the Heaven Wasteland Domain, Ye Qingyu had placed the uncompleted [Blood Drinker Sword] in the purple underground fire to continue refining it. It had since been ten days, and there were indeed some changes to the sword’s exterior, while some impurities had been removed. As a result, the sword was about a finger’s length shorter than it used to be.
“The current [Blood Drinker Sword] is already very different from when it was cast using the original formula in the bronze book [Fiendgod Titled Chart]. I wonder how it’ll look like when it has been completely refined... Sigh, I got a little impulsive this time and took too big of a risk. I must make sure not to spoil the refining.”
At this time, he became a little nervous.
Though he did not know how it would eventually look like if he continued to refine it, he was certain that it would be different from what was recorded in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart].
After contemplation, he decided to continue refining it by following the casting technique recorded in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart].
Otherwise, he would not know how to proceed either.
As he sat cross-legged on the surface of the flaming magma, his mind recalled the meaning of the one hundred and eight ancient characters of refinement while his hands continually formed hand prints, every one of which turned into invisible shadows and incessantly soared into the air before striking themselves into the [Blood Drinker Sword] which was being refined among the flames. As time passed, he had successively form thousands of invisible hand print shadows, and gradually, the changes to the [Blood Drinker Sword] became more and more pronounced, while the sword continually became smaller. The wisps of smoke that dissipated from it were in the shapes of the impurities which were continually removed from the divine materials that constituted the sword.
The sword was completely made out of divine materials and was incomparably compact to begin with. As such, impurities could only be removed from it using the profound meaning of Ye Qingyu’s one hundred and eight ancient characters, and only on condition that it had been preheated and refined in the Underground Fire Spirit Spring Sword Pit for ten days prior.
It would have been absolutely difficult for anyone else, even a refining master, to have refined the sword to its current stage.
Time flew by.
An entire night passed.
The [Blood Drinker Sword] had already shrank to one-third of its original size.
Its current size was consistent with the sword size used by the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s warriors.
However, Ye Qingyu could sense a possibility that the [Blood Drinker Sword] would continue to refine further.
The more it is refined, the smaller it gets?
This is not what was recorded in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart].
He guessed with a little uncertainty that the next step was to nourish the sword using blood.
After some hesitation, he dropped his doubts and bit his tongue, causing a mouthful of blood essence to spurt on to the [Blood Drinker Sword] below.
Buzzzz!
As the sword began to vibrate, streaks of ancient blood-colored patterns, which together resembled a dense arrangement of blood vessels, appeared on the sword and absorbed all of the blood essence. The next instant, these patterns seemed to come alive, continually contracting and expanding like a heart. Within them, a frightening power surged, while a burning splendor seemed to be trying to break free. Given Ye Qingyu’s current cultivation, the energy contained within a mouthful of blood essence was even more vast and vigorous than that within divine-level origin crystals. Yet, it was absorbed into the [Blood Drinker Sword] in a twinkling regardless.
As those blood-colored patterns glittered indistinctly, the [Blood Drinker Sword] frantically absorbed the power of the underground fire and eventually began to burn completely. Dark, surging flames submerged the entire sword.
Ye Qingyu immediately felt that there was a new, strange connection between him and the sword, as if they were physically linked.
This was a result of the [Blood Drinker Sword’s] absorption of the stream of blood essence.
Chapter 928 – Recasting the Blood Drinker Sword


After mysteriously getting Ye Qingyu to wait, the empress went in high spirits to change into a white-colored palace long dress. When she returned, she was holding a small sword in her hand. Her hairstyle had changed, with her jet-black long hair draped over her shoulders to her back waist, as dazzlingly beautiful as a waterfall. She had a completely different demeanor about her, resembling a fairy among a bed of flowers. With blooming dimples, she said, “Cousin, I created my own sword technique, and would like you, as the martial champion of the Heaven Wasteland Domain, to advise me on it.”

“A self-created sword technique? Hoho, I’ll indeed like to see what you’ve come up with. Haha, go ahead.” Ye Qingyu laughed as he leaned back against the railings and white marble steps beside a pavilion.

Given her status, she was able to obtain the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s highest level secret books on sword techniques just by asking. Earlier on, it was also her who gave Ye Qingyu the [War God Sword Mantras]. There was thus absolutely no need for her to create her own sword technique. Ye Qingyu figured that this was probably just a young girl’s whimsical plaything, and so he could go easy on it.

“This sword technique of mine is called [Young Xiaoxing of the Fast-Aging Heaven Wasteland].” With that, her small sword shook and began to dance lightly.

A tinge of surprise emerged on Ye Qingyu’s face when he heard this name.

‘The fast-aging Heaven Wasteland’!

‘Young Xiaoxing’.

For a time, he was a little dazed as he watched her sword-dancing among the flowers, resembling a lively flower fairy.

This so-called self-created sword technique of hers could only be considered a sword dance. Although it was magnificent and fascinating to an extreme, it did not have the slightest of killing power. Nevertheless, her purpose for this sword technique was apparently not to kill enemies anyway. Instead, it was simply intended as a light sword dance to be performed in front of someone she loved. Complemented by the flowers in the garden, her absolutely beautiful looks appeared noble, holy, and pure. Her poses were delicate and as light as those of a fairy, as if she was completely untainted by the dirt of the human world. This was a sight so beautiful that it was enchanting.

As an empress sword-dances among the flowers, who can read her little girl heart?

Ye Qingyu stood quietly where he was, his thoughts somewhat confused as he poetized. He didn't even realize when Yu Xiaoxing ended her dance, remaining dull and unresponsive.

“Cousin, brother Qingyu?” The young girl waved her small, fair-complexioned hand in front of him and waggishly snapped him out of his dazed state. A hint of delight flashed across her crescent-moon-like, squinting eyes as she asked, “Cousin, please give me some advice. How would you rate the power of my [Young Xiaoxing of the Fast-Aging Heaven Wasteland] sword technique?”

After glimpsing at her, he said with a smile, “It’s very powerful, and points directly at one’s heart.”

“Are you serious?” Yu Xiaoxing leaped in excitement as she smiled artfully and prettily while revealing her flowery dimples. “I know you’re lying, but I’m still happy enough… However, you shouldn’t be like this, cousin. At present, people inside and outside the palace are trying to figure out my thoughts and are telling what they think I want to hear. You mustn’t deceive me like them.”

Ye Qingyu replied, “Isn’t it good that people are telling you what you want to hear? If you ever get tired of that, you can just find a few pedantic and blunt ministers to tell you the truth.”

Yu Xiaoxing stuck her tongue out, “I’d rather not meet them, for I would get a headache every time I do. Sigh, being an empress is so tiring.”

Ye Qingyu could not help bursting into laughter, “You should be content. Among the Vast Thousand Domains, an emperor like you who can self-isolate whenever in a bad mood, yet can maintain the throne so steadily, would consider themself lucky already.”

“But I don’t like it.” Yu Xiaoxing sighed exaggeratedly.

It was already dusk by the time Ye Qingyu returned to Light City.

After summoning Gao Han, Li Changkong, and Wang Lijin, and with Ximen Yeshui and Wen Wan coincidentally around as well, he brought up the matter of building the Light Arsenal. Halfway through, Mother Wu personally brought over the dinner she had prepared.

“Let’s eat together.” Having not tasted Mother Wu’s dishes for a long time, Ye Qingyu somewhat missed them and thus became excited. This woman, who had followed him from Youyan Pass all the way to Light City, could by now be considered an elderly person of the city. Although she did not have an actual job, she had a son and a daughter serving as Ye Qingyu’s disciples, and so she was given an extremely special and highly-respected status in Light City. Ye Qingyu was reminded of Li Ying, Li Qi, and Bai Yuanxing when he saw her.

Pinching his fingers, he calculated that it had been a year since he sent these three disciples together with one hundred extremely talented children to the Clear River Domain. Although there had been constant communication with the Immortal God Emperor Sect and he thus knew that their cultivation was progressing well, he could not help feeling that it was time to pay them a visit.

He decided to take some time out to go on a trip to the Clear River Domain. Aside from visiting Bai Yuanxing and the others, he also wanted to visit Hu Bugui, Nan Tieyi, Liu Shaji, and some other old acquaintances. It had also been a long time since he met the couple of Ling Xiaoran and Heng Yuge, Chen Zhengliang, and others in Flowing Light City.

Mother Wu cleared the table after dinner was over.

Still holding an unfinished bowl of noodles, Wen Wan said, “My Lord, Ximen Yeshui and I plan to travel to many different domains so as to get to know more about their unique characteristics. We hope that you’ll give us your approval.”

The dark-faced scholar, Ximen Yeshui, also said grinningly, “Indeed, brother. Since the few of us won’t be able to help even if we remain in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, we might as well go explore a couple of new domains. My martial cultivation has reached a bottleneck which I haven’t been able to break through all this time. Perhaps, by chilling out for a bit, I might suddenly gain Dao, hehe!”

Ye Qingyu thought it over and agreed with what they said. Aside from fighting, this bunch was not reliable at doing anything else and would only spoil things. With his promotion to become the third deputy of the Human Race, the situation of the Heaven Wasteland Domain had stabilized for the time being, and thus there was no need for this bunch for the foreseeable future. Perhaps it would be a good thing to let them travel to foreign domains, which the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s current understanding of was limited to the superficial knowledge written about in books and records that could only be verified by letting people go out and explore.

“Yes, I shall approve, but I have two requests. First, you may only depart after the construction of the Light Arsenal is complete. Second, you must first go to the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain to find Luo Yi and help him settle the matter there before proceeding to other domains.” Ye Qingyu stuck two thumbs up and nodded in approval.

It had been more than two months since he left the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain. He figured that Qin Hui and Luo Yi should by now have more or less settled the internal issues of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect and tied up any loose ends. At this time, it should be possible to open a Domain Gate between the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect and the Heaven Wasteland Domain, and officially begin communication and coordination.

“No problem at all.” Ximen Yeshui cheerfully agreed.

“No problem, no problem at all, no problem...” The steel parrot on his shoulder mimicked.

This matter was agreed just like this.

Everyone departed after dinner.

Ye Qingyu dove once more into the Underground Fire Spirit Spring Sword Pit.

He did not enter the small plane hidden within the pit, and instead simply stood in the air above the underground magma river. The underground fire in this pit was slightly milder in temperature than that of the orange underground fire expanse in the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, and was suitable for refining weapons. On the first day of his return to the Heaven Wasteland Domain, Ye Qingyu had placed the uncompleted [Blood Drinker Sword] in the purple underground fire to continue refining it. It had since been ten days, and there were indeed some changes to the sword’s exterior, while some impurities had been removed. As a result, the sword was about a finger’s length shorter than it used to be.

“The current [Blood Drinker Sword] is already very different from when it was cast using the original formula in the bronze book [Fiendgod Titled Chart]. I wonder how it’ll look like when it has been completely refined... Sigh, I got a little impulsive this time and took too big of a risk. I must make sure not to spoil the refining.”

At this time, he became a little nervous.

Though he did not know how it would eventually look like if he continued to refine it, he was certain that it would be different from what was recorded in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart].

After contemplation, he decided to continue refining it by following the casting technique recorded in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart].

Otherwise, he would not know how to proceed either.

As he sat cross-legged on the surface of the flaming magma, his mind recalled the meaning of the one hundred and eight ancient characters of refinement while his hands continually formed hand prints, every one of which turned into invisible shadows and incessantly soared into the air before striking themselves into the [Blood Drinker Sword] which was being refined among the flames. As time passed, he had successively form thousands of invisible hand print shadows, and gradually, the changes to the [Blood Drinker Sword] became more and more pronounced, while the sword continually became smaller. The wisps of smoke that dissipated from it were in the shapes of the impurities which were continually removed from the divine materials that constituted the sword.

The sword was completely made out of divine materials and was incomparably compact to begin with. As such, impurities could only be removed from it using the profound meaning of Ye Qingyu’s one hundred and eight ancient characters, and only on condition that it had been preheated and refined in the Underground Fire Spirit Spring Sword Pit for ten days prior.

It would have been absolutely difficult for anyone else, even a refining master, to have refined the sword to its current stage.

Time flew by.

An entire night passed.

The [Blood Drinker Sword] had already shrank to one-third of its original size.

Its current size was consistent with the sword size used by the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s warriors.

However, Ye Qingyu could sense a possibility that the [Blood Drinker Sword] would continue to refine further.

The more it is refined, the smaller it gets?

This is not what was recorded in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart].

He guessed with a little uncertainty that the next step was to nourish the sword using blood.

After some hesitation, he dropped his doubts and bit his tongue, causing a mouthful of blood essence to spurt on to the [Blood Drinker Sword] below.

Buzzzz!

As the sword began to vibrate, streaks of ancient blood-colored patterns, which together resembled a dense arrangement of blood vessels, appeared on the sword and absorbed all of the blood essence. The next instant, these patterns seemed to come alive, continually contracting and expanding like a heart. Within them, a frightening power surged, while a burning splendor seemed to be trying to break free. Given Ye Qingyu’s current cultivation, the energy contained within a mouthful of blood essence was even more vast and vigorous than that within divine-level origin crystals. Yet, it was absorbed into the [Blood Drinker Sword] in a twinkling regardless.

As those blood-colored patterns glittered indistinctly, the [Blood Drinker Sword] frantically absorbed the power of the underground fire and eventually began to burn completely. Dark, surging flames submerged the entire sword.

Ye Qingyu immediately felt that there was a new, strange connection between him and the sword, as if they were physically linked.

This was a result of the [Blood Drinker Sword’s] absorption of the stream of blood essence.

Chapter 912:


Chapter 929 - Blood Drinker Sword Pellet (1)
Using blood to nourish the sword was different from the [Blood Drinker Sword’s] devouring of enemies’ blood during normal battles and turning them into essential yuan qi to supplement itself. This mouthful of blood essence was fused with the sword via the secret techniques of refining and sword-casting, and thereby enhanced and became communicable with the sword’s spirit. Eventually, the sword would have to be completely turned into a part of Ye Qingyu’s body, like an added limb, for the first step of sword nourishment, known as [Channeling], to be considered successful. The subsequent step was to use one’s spirit to nourish the sword, enabling the sword to become one with one’s spirit. Thereafter, when fighting against enemies, every move and stroke exerted would contain the power of the [Blood Drinker Sword] even if it was not being used. This was the true final form of sword-casting.
It was the [Channeling] step which Ye Qingyu had to perform now.
As he spurted successive mouthfuls of blood essence, the flames on the sword became bigger and more vigorous. Like the burning of an ancient tree, flames of several hundred meters in height erupted, presenting a picture of intermixing lavender and blood-red that possessed a strange beauty. Each time he spurted a mouthful of blood essence, a lively bout of spiritual wave movement would be felt from the sword, akin to the feeling of a baby jumping into the arms of its parents. This was somewhat assuring to Ye Qingyu, as this reaction was a regular one according to the sword-casting technique records in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart].
This continued for a full two hours.
Then, Ye Qingyu stopped spurting blood essence.
This was because the flames on the [Blood Drinker Sword] had burned to the limits, such that no further blood essence could be absorbed. This meant that the refinement this time had reached a saturation point, and now needed to be slowed and warmed down while awaiting for the arrival of the next opportunity.
Sitting cross-legged on the magma, he operated his yuan qi and started to incessantly pinch out the casting hand prints of the one hundred and eight ancient characters. As his ten fingers transformed and gave off a faint silver luster, hand prints were continually struck into the warmly-burning, two-colored flames of the sword. Each time a hand print was struck in, the flames would give a shake while an indistinct roar, which sounded like the beating of pig iron by a giant hammer yet also contained a strange Dao sound, would be heard from the Void. The continual vibrations caused layer upon layer of ripples to form in the surrounding Void.
Just like that, another day passed.
It was already around nightfall in the outside world.
Like burnt-up firewood, the warmly-burning, two-colored flames gradually subsided. Ye Qingyu nervously opened his eyes and stared fixedly at the center of the dissipating flames. For a moment, a black, crude sword embryo appeared in his sights.
This sword embryo looked similar to the former appearance of the [Blood Drinker Sword], except that it was an extremely ugly black color. Its surface could not be any coarser, resembling the bark of an old tree which had been seasoned for several hundred years, and was full of cracks which were each as thick as a finger. It seemed as if a gust of wind would easily blow it off.
Is this the refined [Blood Drinker Sword]?
Ye Qingyu simply dared not believe it.
Could it be that the refining has failed, and the divine materials have been burned into a pile of slag?
That would be a huge loss.
When he chose the Human Race deputy post over the chance to enter the Divine Weapon Hall and pick one of its weapons, he was counting on no more than the [Blood Drinker Sword] and the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. If the former had really been refined until it became unusable, he would truly cry himself to death.
He decided to try summoning the sword.
