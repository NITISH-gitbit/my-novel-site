Chapter 317:


"These people should be the experts who had arrived previously in the divine gate."

Ye Qingyu could largely guess as to who they were.

It was only that he did not recognize the majority of the people here.

But those who were able to reach such a stage must be truly important characters in the outside world.

It was only that their current state where they stood there dumbfoundedly, as if their souls had been absorbed away from their bodies... just what was this?

Ye Qingyu attempted to step on one of the yellow stone tiles to allow the blue light marking to shine on his feet. But after stepping on tens of yellow stone tiles, there wasn't the slightest of effect whatsoever.

"Just what is this?”

Ye Qingyu could not understand.

"Woof, no need to try. You must have came late and missed your opportunity." Little Nine had a face that said ‘Ye Qingyu had failed him’ on his face.

That should not be so.

Ye Qingyu did not too believe in this.

He was about to open his mouth and ask Song Xiaojun to try. But he did not imagine, when he turned around, he would discover that Song Xiaojun had already disappeared without knowing when. The girl who had stood on a demon lotus and appeared, had gone completely. He had no idea where she had gone.

Why was it like this?

The situation became more and more strange.

Would the little girl be in some sort of danger?

Ye Qingyu slapped himself in the head, somewhat worried in his heart. But after careful thought, Song Xiaojun did not seem to be restricted by that humongous 'ordinary' character in the sky within the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]. With her strength, she should not encounter any problems.

After thinking for a while, Ye Qingyu continued ahead beyond the courtyard.

A hundred meters away, he came to the entrance of the divine palace.

There were stone tiles that had strange inscriptions on it floating above the stone steps, as if it was floating on water and was supported by an invisible energy. He walked on the stone steps, step by step. In total they numbered a hundred and eight, until he was on the stone base of the divine palace.

"Hou Hou Hou..."

There was a series of mad and enraged roars coming from demonic beasts that sounded out.

Ye Qingyu was taken aback.

When he turned his head to look, he saw that the massive silver stone gateway to the main entrance of the stone shrine had two large and incomparably mysterious symbols etched onto it. The curved and wacky brushstrokes on it seemed like the scribbles of a little kid, but also a labyrinth that made one dizzy when one beheld it. More importantly, the two large symbols were scarlet red. There was a light dancing within these brush strokes, that looked like fresh blood. There was a sort of abnormal and sorrowful atmosphere that was throughout.

Every hundredth of a breath, the two large blood red symbols would rapidly flicker.

And every time it flickered, there would be a flood-like tide of beasts that appeared from within.

The forms of these demonic beasts were not the same, being of all sorts and sizes. But they all held a berserk and destructive aura about them. Their bloody red eyes flickered with a terrifying bloodthirstiness. They galloped madly, but after running for less than a meter, it seemed as if there was a water ripple in the air. It seemed as if the barriers of space had melted, the demonic beasts entered into the ripple and would disappear to the other side of the water ripple.

Ye Qingyu suppressed the shock in his heart as he neared and observed.

Right now, he could confirm that those demonic beasts which were running madly to attack Deer City, was namely created from these two massive blood red symbols.

Here was the origin of the demonic beasts.

The two symbols on the massive silver stone gate was the origin of all the destruction.

Ye Qingyu had once thought of countless explanations.

But he did not imagine that the end result would be like so.

Just what were these two blood red symbols, that they were able to create such berserk demonic beasts?

Ye Qingyu neared, wanting to inspect from a closer distance.

But when he was less than ten meters away from the massive silver stone gate, something unexpected happen. The two large and strange demonic symbols suddenly emitted faint mist. It was like an invisible giant hand that lightly smothered it, wiping away these two symbols.

The demonic blood red symbols had disappeared.

The huge silver stone gate returned to normal.

And then there were no more demonic beasts that came charging and roaring out.

The barrier in the air a meter away also disappeared.

The endless roars and howls of the beast also disappeared.

Ye Qingyu still had not yet grasped what had occurred--

Crash!

The huge silver stone door in front of him let out a rumble, slowly and gradually opening.

A vast power of thunder surged out from the stone doors. Faintly, it was as if they could hear the roars of Gods and Devils fighting. They were able to hear singing of heavenly girls. They were able to hear the laughter of giant demonic lifeforms, hear the noise of life forms killing each other, hear the weeping of divine kings...

There were countless sounds that did not belong to the world.

The vast power of thunder grabbed at Ye Qingyu. He could not even struggle, there was no way of resisting, even if he underwent dragonification. His entire person was slowly being carried into the opened gate.

Little Nine was also similarly dragged inside.

As well as the Little Silver dragon that had transformed into a hairpin.

These fellows felt something was wrong, and did their utmost to struggle. The figure of the silly dog expanded, his paws gripping the stone door tightly. The Little Silver dragon also exposed his true form, his draconic talons grabbing at the door, wanting to help drag Ye Qingyu out together. But ultimately, they were all pulled within the stone door, entering into the divine shrine.

Then the large silver stone door shut.

Nearly at the same time.

A strange light ripple, with the divine palace at the center, surged out towards the open yard.

Those experts who were dumbly standing where they were, gazing at the heavens, had the light wave flicker through their body. Instantly, it was as if they awakened from their dreams, recovering to normality. There was joy as well as shock on their faces. They looked at their surroundings, then became cautious...

"What happened?"

"Could this have been an illusion?"

"I seem to have gained something."

"Is the formation palace in front of us?"

"The Legacy of his majesty Luo So should be within the divine palace.“

"But we have no way of entering."

"We've only just reached the open yard, but we could not help but stay here and comprehend the Dao. Then within the divine palace, there must be something even more ridiculous?"

There was a series of low discussion.

Those experts who had been awakened from amidst their enlightenment, comprehended what they had been able to obtain. They were all overjoyed. They had not imagined that there would be such a fortuitous encounter within the formation yard. Only they themselves knew what they had obtained, but from the expressions of everyone, one could determine it was something great.

The yellow stone tiles below their feet flickered.

Those strange blue markings and patterns disappeared from the yellow tiles, and appeared on their palms.

Those blue patterns were like they were etched onto their skin. It would appear and disappear as they willed it.

At the same time, the 'ordinary' character floating above the air completely disappeared.

The restrictive power also disappeared that had suppressed them previously.

"Ah... I can use my inner yuan once again."

"The power of yuan qi has returned.”

"Hahaha, this is too great. I can finally recover my normal strength."

This unexpected event caused everyone to become excited. Power had once again returned to their bodies, returning a sense of security to everyone.

There were some people who looked at the strange blue markings that had appeared on their palms.

They attempted to insert a strand of yuan qi into the blue markings.

Boom!

A huge blue light shot towards the sky, like a sharp divine sword. It tore through space, even slicing apart the fabric of space.

"This..." Even the person himself was shocked.

He had only inserted a tiny portion of yuan qi, but it had displayed such a powerful offensive ability... this, was this the legendary legacy that the [Formation Sovereign] had left behind?

Boom Boom!

There were blue lights that constantly tore through space.

Evidently, the others had also discovered the frightening ability of the blue pattern on their hands.

"Hahaha..." There were people madly laughing.

Ximen Yeshui also looked at his own palm, his heart overjoyed.

The blue light pattern in his palm was exactly the same as the blue under his feet on the yellow stone tiles. In other words, after such a temporary experience and comprehension, he had obtained the power of that seal on the yellow tile.

Although he had not tried it yet, but he could be sure that the blue light on his right hand had not yet demonstrated its full power. As he continued to examine and mull over it, it's power would definitely increase.

Was this the legacy left behind by the [Formation Sovereign], his majesty Luo So?

The Qin Zhishui by the side held his blade in his right hand and activated the formation light in his hand. The blue light instantly wrapped around the red silk battle blade in his right hand. A powerful blade will instantly spread about everywhere.

He did not strike out.

But the power was already evident.

Even with Qin Zhishui's calm demeanour, he could not help but smile.

This exploration had risk their lives several times over. He had finally received a reward in the journey to the formation palace.

He and Ximen Yeshui had ran here madly. When they reached the open yard, they could see the crowd of people standing therir dumbly. Before they could notice anything, the yellow stone tiles below their feet suddenly let out a blue light. Then their body, as if it could not be controlled, like their souls had left their body and entered into a strange environment, was met with a series of test. Hence, they began their enlightenment.

Such a process, seemed long, but also fleeting.

From the current situation, it was evident the people of the yard had unintentionally activated the blue light on the stone tiles and each received their fortuitous encounter.

Such a result, was something no one had expected.

They originally thought, when they reached the formation palace, there would be a great bloody battle. Only those with the strongest strength or perhaps the greatest fortune, would be able to obtain the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign] after paying a certain price.

Who would have imagined everyone would receive something.

This great battle should be able to be prevented.

========================================

Chapter 318:


“Oh? Where’s my brother? I can’t see him?”
Ximen Yeshui evaluated his surroundings. Within the crowd, he could not see Ye Qingyu at all.
As Qin Zhishui heard this, he also hurriedly began searching amongst his surroundings.
There were only about twenty or so people on the yard. Sweeping his eyes everywhere, he really did not see Ye Qingyu’s figure.
“My silly brother, will he still be burying the dead people below the mountain?” Ximen Yeshui’s face had gone green. “At this time, how can he not even be the slightest hasty, and act so slow and leisurely… But thankfully, there are at least over ten thousand yellow tiles below us. Even if he comes late, he will definitely be able to obtain a piece, and obtain the formation light seal.”
Qin Zhishui nodded his head. “En, brother Ximen is correct. He does not need to be too impatient.”
The greedy people near them had already began to see if they could activate other yellow stone tiles, to see if they could obtain other formation seal lights nearby. But evidently, they were not successful. No matter how hard they tried, they had no way of activating a second yellow stone tile.
If their guesses were not wrong, although there were over ten thousand of these tiles, each person could only obtain a single tile.
When the blue seal light was transferred to the person’s palm, the yellow stone tile they were standing on before would become empty. There would not be any trace left behind.
“That’s not right, this should not be the entire legacy of the [Formation Sovereign], his majesty Luo So,” here was someone that suddenly shouted.
Everyone turned to look at him.
This was an old man that seemed especially fierce. He had long hair, half completely black like ink and half completely white like snow. It was like yin and yang, and seemed extremely strange. His eyebrows stood like steel needles, nearly forming a straight ‘one’ character, a completely horizontal line. There was a blood red blade scar on his right eyebrow, and his aura was as piercing as an eagle, his gaze extremely sharp.
“Everyone, if my guess is not wrong, the true legacy of his majesty Luo So, is within the divine palace. What we just received is just a little appetizer. Don’t be satisfied yet, we still need to work together to enter into the divine palace to truly obtain the absolute treasure,” the fierce yin and yang old man advised.
“Haha, [Yin Yang Monarch], don’t you always act alone? Why is it today you suggested that we should work together? Could the world have completely changed?” Someone sneered as they stood out. It was an old man that was chubby and short, like he was a meatball. There was a pair of half moon shaped shields behind his back, that when joined together, would look like a turtle shell. His aura was equally powerful.
“Haha, Turtle Shell immortal, yesterday is not like today. When the matter concerns the absolute most sacred treasure of the Human Race, we must be more cautious. If we cooperate, we will have a higher chance of obtaining the treasure…” The [Yin Yang Monarch] laughed like he was chuckling at a retard.
“Hmph, you know best what kind of intentions you yourself have.” The Turtle Shell immortal said with a snort.
But many people were moved by the words of the [Yin Yang Monarch].
The human heart would never know when to be satisfied.
After they obtained something, they would want to obtain more.
Everyone’s gaze turned towards the divine palace.
When they had previously arrived at the open yard, when they stepped onto the yellow stone tiles, they could not help but enter into a state of comprehension. Therefore, they still had not entered the divine palace.
Seeing the divine palace now, everyone’s eyes were filled with an excited glimmer.
“My little brother, why have you still not appeared. If you come later, not to mention meat, you can’t even drink the soup.” Ximen Yeshui was so impatient that he stamped his feet, pacing back and forth. Seeing that Ye Qingyu had not appeared yet, he was somewhat worried that he might have encountered some sort of danger.
Qin Zhishui also tensely looked about.
There were already people heading towards the divine palace.
Everyone very quickly arrived at the entrance to the divine palace.
There were people who were about to step onto the stone steps, but then was rejected soundly backwards by an invisible energy.
“En? What is this?”
There were other people that attempted to do this, but was similarly rejected from the stone steps.
“There’s a restriction?”
The [Yin Yang Monarch] also tried, but was also rejected by the invisible power. There was absolutely no way of stepping onto the stone steps. Leaping past the stone steps was absolutely impossible. Everywhere around the divine palace was a strange energy protecting it, there was no way of traversing it.
“Let’s just blow it open.” An expert coldly snorted. A powerful energy emitted from his hand, and struck towards the stone steps.
Boom!
An energy that was several times greater came rebounding backwards.
“Puh… Chi!”
This expert was sent flying backwards, blood spurting out from his mouth.
“This is the palace of the [Formation Sovereign]. It is not a wise choice to choose to attempt to forcefully enter it. If he wants to give it to you, you will obtain it. If he doesn’t want to give it to you, you won’t be able to forcefully gain it.” The expert that had the lower half of his body destroyed opened his mouth, “It seems that only those who are destined will be able to step onto the stone steps, and obtain the absolute treasure of the legacy.”
This person had a head of messy hair, dried up like wild grass. His muscles were engorged, and one could tell he was once incomparably muscular. But his lower half had been destroyed, and seemed devastating. However, the blue light seal in his palm emitted blue light, transforming into his legs and supporting his body.
“Haha, cultivation is going against the heavens, everything can be obtained. Crippled old bastard, your words are somewhat false,” the [Yin Yang Monarch] coldly sneered. “Could it be that you are about to leave the crowd, and give up on gaining something?”
“This person, is the [Heavenly Crippled Legs] Mo Lingfeng.” Ximen Yeshui had an expression like he had just seen a ghost, grabbing at the Qin Zhishui next to him.
Qin Zhishui was stunned. “That can’t be. Did we not just see his corpse in the blood red sea…”
“That was only half his body. Those monsters of the Heaven Ascension stage, even if they have lost half their body, they won’t die. They are really hard to kill…”
“Did you not say you have once seen him before?” Qin Zhishui suddenly thought of something. “You said, a hundred years ago, elder Mo had once appeared to your sect. In other words… you are already over a hundred years old?”
“Eh? No, I am only just twenty…” Ximen Yeshui stammered. “I said I had seen him, but he did not see me. I have many people in my sect… eh, why are we concerned with such unimportant matters. Right now, we should decide whether we should go back and find that bastard that likes to bury people, and help him get something from this place?”
Qin Zhishui gave this fellow a glance, about to nod his head.
At this time—
“The day that the divine palace will open has already passed. The fated person has already stepped into the divine palace. Everyone has already gained their own fortuitous encounter, so don’t trespass on the divine palace any longer. When the time is right, you will be sent away from the palace.”
There was a strict and authoritative voice that suddenly sounded out in the skies.
The voice appeared without any warning, like it was an absolute monarch that ruled over all life. There was an authority within its voice that could not be questioned.
Everyone felt their consciousness quaking, their hearts moved. They had no way of controlling themselves.
When the voice disappeared, the experts all looked at each other, shock in their eyes.
“Could it be… the voice of his majesty Luo So?”
“Impossible, his majesty Luo So has already… already passed. This… how?”
“No, perhaps it means… that his majesty Luo So did not perish. Heavens, if news of this was to be passed on…” There was someone that became moved.
The complexion of the [Yin Yang Monarch] changed constantly. He had a dark face, saying, “Hmph, don’t be so positive. It might not be his majesty Luo So, perhaps it is the voice a part of his consciousness has left behind, or perhaps… someone is pretending to be him?”
As these words were said, everyone’s heart was moved.
With such an absolute treasure in front of them, who would be willing to patiently wait and watch others obtain such a fortuitous encounter?
“Who is it? Who entered into the divine palace?”
“That’s not right. Those who entered at the start are all here… could it be someone that came later?”
People began discussing.
The experts who were able to come here were all people who had experienced countless killings. They had danced in endless mountains of corpses and oceans of blood. Their battle experience was unspeakably full, and they were all people who had absolute self confidence. They naturally would not act like obedient children after a sudden voice sounded out from the sky, and be willing to wait patiently.
There were still people who constantly attempted to break through the protection of the divine palace and forcefully enter.
There were even people who used the blue light seal in their hands, to attack the invisible barrier of the divine palace. But there was not the slightest hint of progress.
Ximen Yeshui and Qin Zhishui were behind the crowd, not attempting to even try to break past the protection of the divine palace.
“Hey, do you think the fellow who entered into the divine palace is my brother?” Ximen Yeshui spoke with a low voice.
Qin Zhishui was taken aback, “This… is hard to say.”
“Haha, if in the end the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign] was obtained by that fellow that likes to bury people while everyone bitterly ran everywhere, this would be really far too amusing.” Ximen Yeshui had a tone of delighting in others misfortune.
Qin Zhishui had an exasperated tone as he said to him, “Could it be that you do not want to obtain your own fortuitous encounter?”
Ximen Yeshui laughed at him, spreading his hands wide. “I have already obtained the blue formation seal. My limit for fortuitous encounters has already been reached. Humans have to know when to be satisfied. Haha, furthermore, my brother obtaining it is the same as me obtaining it. I am only curious, just what sort of fortuitous encounter it is. Could it really be the inheritance of his majesty Luo So?”
The two spoke in suppressed voices.
But they were still heard by people beside them.
The [Yin Yang Monarch] ‘s gaze landed on Ximen Yeshui. He frowned, saying, “Your brother is who? What’s he called?”
The aura of a Heaven Ascension expert instantly descended.
Qin Zhishui felt like a stone was pressed against his heart. When the gaze of the [Yin Yang Monarch] landed on him, he had a feeling of suffocation.
But Ximen Yeshui did not even pay the [Yin Yang Monarch] a look. Pressing his lips together, “That’s none of your bloody business.”
The gaze full of wisdom instantly became poisonous and sinister.
……
……
“Elder, it’s you?”
Ye Qingyu was surprised.
When the gates of the divine palace had opened and he was dragged in by the power of thunder, Ye Qingyu bitterly struggled but was not able to escape. The power of lightning was not the same as normal lighting. It constantly traversed throughout Ye Qingyu’s body, like it was a heavenly punishment, nearly tearing him apart.
“Oh? Where’s my brother? I can’t see him?”
Ximen Yeshui evaluated his surroundings. Within the crowd, he could not see Ye Qingyu at all.
As Qin Zhishui heard this, he also hurriedly began searching amongst his surroundings.
There were only about twenty or so people on the yard. Sweeping his eyes everywhere, he really did not see Ye Qingyu’s figure.

========================================

Chapter 319:


Chapter 320 - Elder of the Human Race

At the side, Little Nine and Little Silver were also screaming repeatedly.

This whole process lasted one full hour.

Ye Qingyu felt that the lightning was about to split his body into particles.

But unexpectedly, after an hour, the frightening deity-class rumbling of thunder suddenly disappeared.

Ye Qingyu was exhausted, floating in space.

Inside the palace, it was incomparably dim.

Rows of huge old stone bookcases loomed out in the dim light. The shelves were at least hundreds of meters high and all sorts of ancient books were densely packed inside. The spines were flickering with strange words and there was a bizarre and powerful aura coming from the books, as though every book had a terrifying and powerful devil sealed within.

The bookcases, tier upon tier, were endless, like it was a forest of bookcases.

Ye Qingyu could not see how big the palace was.

But he was certain that the bookcases, ancient books and the tens of thousands of books he saw were just a little section of it, like a grain of sand in a desert.

While he was gaping in astonishment, a figure appeared before his eyes.

A familiar figure.

A familiar scent.

It was the illusionary figure that he had come across in the mysterious cemetery of the Snow Dragon deep inside the snow dragon’s den beneath the Explosive Snow Glacier.

It was the mysterious person that suddenly awakened from million of years of slumber, saw the abnormality within Ye Qingyu’s body, and taught Ye Qingyu the profound meaning of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] martial path. When he left, he said he was in search to find traces of the past, finding ways to restore his former strength.

This person was definitely an absolute expert of peerless strength.

Ye Qingyu already knew him from before.

But he did not think that he would meet this man again today at the Moving Imperial Palace of the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So.

“Elder, it’s you?”

Ye Qingyu exclaimed.

“Little friend, we meet again.” The mysterious person was much more real than the last time and not like illusory smoke that would be blown away by the wind at any time. He could vaguely see his face. He had an exceptional aura and there was a smile spread across his face.

“I didn’t expect to see elder here, it really is...” Ye Qingyu, not knowing what to say, respectfully bowed before he continued, “Really is unexpected. It was elder that saved me?”

The mysterious person laughed, “Little friend is referring to the divine punishment of thunder and lightning?”

Ye Qingyu nodded.

“Not at all, I led it here for you.” The mysterious man laughed.

“What does elder mean?” Ye Qingyu stared blankly at him.

“The power of the thunder and lightning of this imperial palace can strengthen the body. This is especially so for people at the Bitter Sea stage, it is the best object to strengthen the body. So after some thought, I led it here for you.” The mysterious man’s gaze flitted over Ye Qingyu, nodding satisfiedly. “Originally, I thought that to be able to master 60% of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] in less than a year of time was already regarded as especially gifted, but I did not think that you were even more impressive and had comprehended it completely. Now, you can even enter into the form of the dragon.”

He had seen Ye Qingyu’s dragon form trying to escape the gate of the palace.

“Elder you flatter me. When I was in the 18th fog zone, I accidentally understood the true meaning of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] by mistake and managed to transform into the dragon. I was going the wrong direction all along and had nearly disappointed elder,” Ye Qingyu said in a low, ashamed tone.

“An opportunity is often gained through trial and error,” the mysterious man stated. “But if there is no talent and understanding, one would never reach this step. You are very good.”

Ye Qingyu thanked him again.

“In the cemetery of the snow dragon, I had observed your cultivation level, the growth of your inner yuan was obvious. And with the nameless breathing technique, there was no improvements needed, but you do not know the right way of strengthening and refining your body. The constitution of your body is rare, but without effective strengthening and refining you will not reach your full potential. So I taught you the first ancient technique of refining the body, the [True Will of the Sky Dragon], hoping to use the power of the dragon clan to pave the way for you. It is gratifying to see little friend’s progress today.”

The mysterious person nodded.

“Elder’s kindness, I am really grateful.” Ye Qingyu finally realized the reason the mysterious person taught him the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].

From the simple conversation back then, Ye Qingyu was able to feel the compassion and kindness of the mysterious person.

It was a real compassion for mankind, the image that an outstanding elder of the Human Race should have.

His care and help to him were like guiding the younger generation of the Human Race.

“If the Human Race wants to survive in this vast world, it needs more people like you.” The mysterious man sighed. “On your way here, what had happened in the fog and at the foot of the mountain, I have seen it, and i thought it was very good. If not a person of kindness, tremendous courage and wisdom, one cannot set foot on the emperor’s road. To revive the fortune of the Human Race, there must be a new emperor. Only then will there be a glimmer of hope.”

“Although our Human Race is now declining, but it is still regarded as one of the top ten races in the world. However, elder seems slightly pessimistic, what is the reason behind this...” Ye Qingyu cautiously asked.

From the words of the mysterious man, it gave the feeling that the Human Race was on the verge of impending catastrophe.

“In the future, you’ll know...” The mysterious person shook his head. “Since awakening, I had observed the situation everywhere. The situation million of years ago, not only has not been restored, but has worsened. Back then, even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could not change the situation, and now the talents of my Human Race is declining, it really is... sigh.”

As Ye Qingyu listened, he felt heart pounding-apprehension.

What situation?

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors back then were known as invincible, roaming the universe, threatening million of races, and pressuring the other races to the point of being unable to breathe easily. The Human Race was mighty and powerful, what was the situation that not even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could resolve?

“Forget it, these past events, lets not talk about it.” The mysterious man shook his head, his tone becoming relaxed again.

“Luo So’s palace traveled through space and time and descended here, it is an opportunity. My arrangement before can also be considered as sowing some seeds and sparking fire for the Human Race of the Heaven Wasteland Domain. Luo So this old fool, back then, he liked to leave a number of suspicious palaces everywhere to deceive people. He was harsh and stingy, and the genuinely precious things he possessed, he would never give to other people so easily, so gradually no one played with him anymore. Haha in this false palace, there is no good things, only the deity punishment of thunder and lightning that the old fool obtained from the sea of thunder from the Deity Domain. It is beneficial in strengthening your body, and is also an opportunity.”

Luo So this old fool?

Ye Qingyu was so startled that he almost bit off his tongue.

My heavens.

Since ancient times, who dares call the [Formation Sovereign] that?

Could it be that the mysterious man was comparable to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors back then, or was he an old friend of the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So?

Although he already knew that the background of the mysterious person was astonishing, but hearing his tone of voice, he was still shocked.

And from his manner of expression and the fact that he could access the palace of the [Formation Sovereign], it was evident that he is very familiar with this place.

Ye Qingyu was more and more curious about the background of the mysterious person.

“Could it be that everything that happened was secretly arranged by you, elder?” Ye Qingyu captured a trace of information from the words of the mysterious man and respectfully asked.

“That’s not it.” The mysterious person smiled. “I just calculated the place that the moving imperial palace would appear and I heard that you went back in Deer City, so I thought that you may come here and take a look. And it just so happens that in this palace, there is something that I need for me to recover.”

“Has elder been watching over me?” Ye Qingyu asked curiously.

“After I left the cemetery of the snow dragon, I traveled all over the world to look for old traces and to observe the new world. I wandered indefinitely, and it just happens to coincide with the opening of this false palace. I followed the traces, passed by Youyan Pass and stayed a few days there. I obviously heard news about you. Then you left the pass and at that time I also arrived at Deer City. When the palace gate opened and dense fog appeared, obviously all sides were alarmed. I thought that you would come here so I came here to provide my assistance.”

The mysterious man smiled as he explained.

“I had to trouble elder to guide me, I am incredibly thankful.” Ye Qingyu deeply bowed once again. Ever since the cemetery of the snow dragon, the mysterious person has been concerned about him, like a closely related elder.

“There’s obviously a reason that I helped you. I hope you would be qualified to become a chess person, and not a chess piece. In the future, I hope you can be like the sages of the past, and continue to guide the Human Race,” the mysterious man said in a hopeful tone, looking at Ye Qingyu with a meaningful glance.

“I will do my best,” Ye Qingyu said solemnly.

“What you’ve done, I have heard. You’ve done well.” The mysterious man evidently thought highly of Ye Qingyu. He not only thought highly of Ye Qingyu’s ability, but Ye Qingyu’s style of handling a situation and his nature. Of course, there were perhaps some other reasons.

“From elder’s words, it seems you are particularly familiar with the palace. Could it be back then...” Ye Qingyu could not help asking after holding himself back several times.

“Back then, Luo So and I were friends, so I know a little about the old fool,” the mysterious man explained.

“Just now, elder said that this is a false palace?” In Ye Qingyu’s heart there were countless questions, but facing the mysterious man, he had the feeling of a junior confronting an elder and felt that he should not bombard him with questions. He had to consider which are reasonable questions before carefully putting them forward.

The mysterious person smiled, and with the flick of his long sleeve, the surroundings lit up. The entire shrine was bright and everything could be seen clearly.

The scene that Ye Qingyu vaguely saw before was indeed correct.

The interior of the shrine was much more wide and tremendous than the outside plaza, but was occupied by countless huge ancient stone bookcases, which were crammed with all sorts of books made from different materials. Within each book was a bizarre and majestic power gushing out...

Ye Qingyu had never seen such a huge library.

He was already astonished when he saw the outline before with the help of the light from the lightning, but now that he saw everything clearly he was speechless. The White Deer Academy library, which is known as the largest treasure of books in Deer City, when compared with this shrine, its collection of books was less than that on one bookcase.

========================================

Chapter 320:


Chapter 321, Great opportunity

“These are some scribbles of Luo So when he was bored. Before his Dao was truly complete, he lived here in seclusion for a period of time. Once he reached the pinnacle of his Dao, this place was abandoned so of course this is not his real palace.”

The mysterious person explained and then as if he thought of something, he shook his head and smiled.

“But these books...” Ye Qingyu could clearly feel that in each book there was boundless power surging within, like a legendary level martial arts book.

The mysterious man nodded. “These books are the works of Luo So when he was at his most confused and lost time of his life. The content is incomplete and some of the things recorded in the books possess demonic attributes. If these were to circulate around or fall into a sinister person’s hand, not only would it not benefit the Human Race, but would bring disaster to the people and endless terrible, consequences.”

So this was it.

Ye Qingyu vaguely understood something.

“This palace is actually a land of death. After Luo So reached the peak, he planned to destroy these books, but they books are the fruits of his blood, sweat and tears. Unable to part with them, he set up a formation, stashed away these books and hoped that one day the formation martial path of the Human Race would flourish and the future generations would not need to rely on his research’s success to dominate the world. At that time, these books can finally see the world and can be regarded as a stage of exploration and understanding. But now it seems that after Luo So, nobody of the future generations can reach his former glory. It seems that these books will have to be permanently stored here.”

The mysteriously man did not hide anything from Ye Qingyu, answering his questions one after another very patiently.

“The land of the death? But along the way, we had not come across any killing formations, the plaza and...” Ye Qingyu was puzzled again.

The mysterious man smiled. “If I had not come, let alone the sea of blood, you would not have even passed the 18 fog zones,” the mysterious man said, “On this road, there are death traps everywhere. Ordinary people would be left at the door and if someone forced their way in, they would be instantly crushed to pieces. There had been strong people from other tribes that followed the clues and forced their way in, but were ultimately left to disintegrate into bones in the sea of blood. I took a look at the hub mirror of the imperial palace. Ever since Luo So closed the palace, there has only been one person who has been able to enter so far and remain at the entrance to the divine palace.”

Ye Qingyu listened intently, breaking into a cold sweat.

It turns out that there are such things behind the so-called gate opening of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign].

“The person that elder talked about had managed to enter the shrine?” Ye Qingyu asked curiously.

“On the entrance of the shrine, did you see two scarlet formation markings on the stone gate?” the mysterious man asked in response.

Ye Qingyu nodded.

“The person of a different tribe that broke into here was considered a brilliant genius, especially in the formation martial path. His talent and skills were not inferior to Luo So, but unfortunately when he attempted to enter into here, he had not yet reached his pinnacle. The death traps along the way had erased many of his skills and so when he finally arrived at the entrance to the palace, he could not break in and his path back was sealed. In despair, he engraved two blood demonic markings on the stone gate of the shrine, that could produce an endless stream of demonic beasts, but also with his own energy and blood as source, he reversed the order of [Fog of Annihilation] to constantly send out demonic beasts. He eventually died at the entrance of the shrine gate. ”

The mysterious man explained.

Ye Qingyu suddenly realized something.

Although he had seen various runes markings along the way, he always felt that the two blood coloured rune markings on the stone gate exhibited a different strength and aura to the blue rune formation light markings on the public square. No wonder this was the case. They contained a strong stench of blood and decay. It turns out that they were not left behind by the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So himself.

That strong person of a different tribe is indeed a genius; he could combine his own blood with rune formations, engraving a rune formation marking that could produce an endless stream of demonic beasts. This method is like nature creating life from out of thin air, a skill only a supreme deity or genius demon possesses. It could be imagined what level of strength and cultivation this person had reached.

A genius like that was ultimately destroyed by the formation that the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So set up, which is enough to show how magnificent Luo So’s skills were.

No wonder that the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, a total of eight existences, could support the existence of the Human Race in the huge world over thousands of races.

Thinking about the past, the ancestors of the Human Race were so accomplished and domineering.

But now?

Not matter how Ye Qingyu considered, there was another issue.

If this was the origin of the demonic beast horde, then why would they madly attack Deer City after leaving the 18 fog zones? Could it be that, hiding in Deer City, there is something related to the genius of the different tribe that the elder mentioned?

Moreover, that day when he was defending the city, the attack of the silver dagger from the demonic beast horde, what did it represent?

Ye Qingyu did not hide anything and spoke out all the confusions on his mind.

“Oh? That happened?” The mysterious person was also a little surprised to hear about this. “The dagger you talked about, do you have it? Let me take a look.”

Ye Qingyu took out the small silver sword and handed it over.

The little sword was suspended in front of the mysterious man.

In his eyes, there was a strange light roaming around, before falling on the body of the little sword.

Very quickly, the mysterious man shook his head and said, “It’s just an ordinary spiritual weapon, the casting technique is peculiar, but it should be the works of a modern casting master. The several rune formations on the inside are the most suitable to launch a surprise attack. It’s not an ancient object, and should have nothing to do with the demonic beast horde. It’s possible that someone is using the demonic beast horde as cover to do something secretly.”

He finished speaking, then the small silver sword slowly floated over to in front of Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu withdrew the dagger, nodding, “Thank you for elder’s guidance.”

The insight and judgment of the mysterious man would not be wrong.

Then that meant the origin of the silver sword was not related to the demonic beast horde. It was just that someone used the demonic beast horde as a cover to do some dirty things, but to be able to use the berserk demonic beasts as a cover and to silently do something like this, then the strength of this person must be strong. He should not be underestimated.

As for the battle when his parents died defending the city, the trail seemed to have been broken at this point.

He thought that he would be able to discover the truth regarding the death of his parents from the [Base of the Formation Sovereign], but it seems that Ye Qingyu was misled from the very beginning. This place and the death of his parents were not related at all.

Knowing this, Ye Qingyu did not know whether he was disappointed or relieved.

“Little friend, time is almost up, there is one last opportunity. I protected you and obtained this opportunity. This place is about to once again escape into another time and space,” the mysterious man stated.

Ye Qingyu looked puzzled. “Last opportunity? Elder means...”

The mysterious man gave a slight smile, pointing to behind Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu turned around, but could only see Little Nine and Little Silver floating silently in the space of the shrine, two of the most noisy fellows looked to be in a deep sleep, calm and peaceful, eyes closed and breathing steadily. But what was the most surprising was that strands of light yellow vapour that were visible to the naked eye were flowing out from the books on the forest-like bookcases and silently penetrating into their bodies.

Ever since entering the palace, Ye Qingyu had repeatedly encountered unexpected things and was frequently astonished, especially after seeing the mysterious person he was too excited that he was unaware of the two little guys’ unusual condition.

“These books, although they are the works of Luo So before he reached mastery, but Luo So’s strength at that time was already at the level of a miracle. Even if he left just a scrap behind, it would hold the essence of the Dao. It has drifted in the waves of time and space for countless years. It has passed countless places of densely concentrated natural yuan qi, and obtained the natural Spirit qi from that domain. For a martial cultivator, such a power is perfect. It was the thing most suited and was known as the Origin Crystal of the books. If you were able to absorb just a tiny bit of it’s power, you were sure to benefit,”he mysterious person said.

Ye Qingyu’s heart was suddenly pounding with excitement.

This was indeed a great opportunity.

The books in the shrine, which had existed for at least millions of years, had almost become spiritual beings. The spiritual energy inside, whether in force or thickness, is far beyond the power of ordinary crystals. If you can absorb this energy, it is basically equal to obtaining the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So’s inheritance. It is absolutely the dream of countless people, but...

Ye Qingyu took a deep breath and said, “Elder, if I can further the level of yuan qi another step that would be the best, but my inner yuan cultivation is already not stable, it is as though I had taken a shortcut to arrive at this level. Previously, I already felt that the strength of my body could not match the inner yuan. If I take another shortcut at this time, most likely... most likely my foundation would be unstable, and will inevitably, inevitably...”

“Hahaha.” The mysterious man laughed. “Good, to be able to keep your true heart when facing this opportunity, it is rare, but had you forgotten that at the beginning of entering the shrine, you had endured the wrath of the deity punishment of thunder and lightning? What do you think that is for? Test your physical strength now.”

Ye Qingyu was shocked.

It was only now that he had realized the changes within his body. He slightly moved his limbs and immediately there were the crackling and booming sounds of thunder coming from his bones and muscles, as though there was a steady flow of thunder and lightning roaming around his body. A kind of weak and numb feeling emerged, but immediately faded away. Moving his fists and feet, there was a feeling that he only felt before when he transformed into the sky dragon.

But this time, he did not transform into a dragon.

It turns out that the deity punishment of thunder and lightning was to enhance his physical strength.

He suddenly realized why the mysterious man said that there was one main reason for him to come to this moving imperial palace this time. It was for him. Indeed, this time was the same as the last time in the cemetery of the Snow Dragon when he obtained the [Supreme Ice Flame], that if not for the help of this mysterious elder, he would have been reduced to ashes by the deity punishment of thunder and lightning, and it would not have been so easy for him to strengthen his body.
