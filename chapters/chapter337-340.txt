Chapter 337:


Chapter 338 - The Era of the Sect Returning

The origin of the treacherous little sword was a mystery. Ever since five years ago, it was a mystery, but from the beginning till now, it has a close relationship with the Ye family. Regarding the person or the force behind it, as Ye Qingyu’s biggest enemy, was not overemphasizing in the slightest.

In such a moment, Ye Qingyu suddenly had an impulse to open the coffin.

His parents have been buried for five years, yet this treacherous little silver sword still wants to attack the stone coffins. Is it because that in the stone coffins was a secret hiding within? Or was it that his parents had not died at all?

Ye Qingyu felt a sudden rush of excitement.

But when his hand almost touched the stone coffin, he hesitated.

Since his mother had repeatedly told himself in the letter that he must place the stone coffins into Deer River and not open the coffin, then there must be a reason. Perhaps five years ago, she already knew what would happen today. If this was part of the plan, and he hastily opened the coffin, would it spoil the plan?

Ye Qingyu’s mind was filled with tangled thoughts, rambling around.

He finally drew a deep breath, lightly touched the stone coffin, and sent a faint wave of yuan qi to investigate. He immediately determined that in the stone coffin, there was indeed a corpse, which had not decayed, and at the right side of the stone coffin vaguely emitted the smell of the treacherous little sword... Nothing was wrong.

Disappointed?

Ye Qingyu silently stood in the void for a long moment, and then finally, slowly sank the two stone coffins into Deer River.

He ultimately did not open the stone coffins to investigate.

The stone coffins slowly sank into Deer River and with the surging force and gushing of river water, it was unknown where it would eventually be swept. The stone coffins were eventually swallowed by the muddy water and struck by chunks of ice. There was a thunderous water noise as sediments were washed down from the source of the river, and with the amount of water vapour in the air, the entire river channel was cloaked in a misty shroud.

Ye Qingyu again stood above the river for another long while, before returning to the riverside.

Next, Ye Qingyu, with the reminder of the person in charge, completed the ceremony, and thanked all the guests. After half an hour, he returned to Ye Mansion following the road that they came from.

Following the moving of the grave, it was already midday when they returned.

When his parents were buried in the cemetery, Ye Qingyu always felt like they were by his own side. Whenever he thought of them, he could go see them. He could always kneel in front of the grave to speak to them, as though his parents were just asleep under the ground and that they could hear him. But the stone coffins had sunk into the river, meaning that he would never see them again. For Ye Qingyu, this was tantamount to another heart-wrenching parting.

While cultivating in the back garden, Ye Qingyu felt restless. He felt empty, like he had lost something.

For the entire afternoon, Ye Qingyu sat in the pavilion of the garden.

At night, the Ye mansion held another banquet.

This was to acknowledge and express his thanks to the various powers of the city that helped them during the day. Although Ye Qingyu did not plan to fight for power for the Ye household, but he could not always live in isolation. If the Ye household wants to grow and continue to exist in Deer City, he needs to build friendly relations. The last time, no one could step through the door of the Ye mansion, but this time the big and small forces in the city finally had their wishes fulfilled.

After three rounds of wine, the evening lights were all brightly lit.

The guests left.

In the main hall, Ye Qingyu was chatting with Qin Lan, Little Grass, Tang San and other people, roughly explaining some of the future direction of the Ye residence, advising Little Grass in her martial arts training, and left her a set of martial exercises. He also told Tang San to pay attention to some matters when he is with the Dugu group. An hour of time had past.

Having arranged all the matters of the household, Ye Qingyu left Ye mansion under the moonlight.

He would be traveling overnight to the Qing Luan Province, and meet up with the [Bright Sword Ship].

When he opened the door of the Ye mansion, the moonlight was just perfect.

It was almost the early summer, so the temperature was not as cold as in winter.

The breeze gently blew, the willow branches slightly swayed.

Ye Qingyu walked a few steps, when he suddenly sensed something. He twisted around to see that at the swaying shadow of the willow tree was a slim figure in white, standing quietly and looking at him.

“Senior sister Bai?” Ye Qingyu asked, slightly surprised.

Under the willow tree, the gentle and soft swaying shadows, dressed in a white combat outfit Bai Yuqing slowly walked out, an indifferent smile on her face as she said, “Just passing by, Senior brother Ye is leaving?”

Ye Qingyu did not have much antipathy towards this noble girl. He nodded, saying, “Yes, I need to report at the Snow capital, it is time to leave.”

“Oh, then take care.” Bai Yuqing nodded.

Under the moon, with her head kept low, the outline of her beautiful face was more defined, and there was nothing strange in her voice.

Ye Qingyu felt that this goddess of White Deer Academy seemed a bit strange tonight, but he still gave a cupped fist salute and said, “Thank you, senior sister Bai.” After that, he did not know what to say.

The two people were really unfamiliar with each other. Even before, at White Deer Academy, they had not directly interacted with each other and there was no topic that they could talk about.

A moment of silence.

Bai Yuqing smiled. “Then, I’m going.”

With that, she turned away.

She really was just passing by.

Ye Qingyu also did not think too much. Under the dim light of night, he waved goodbye.

It wasn’t until Ye Qingyu’s figure disappeared around the corner in the distance that Bai Yuqing glanced back, staring at the place he disappeared silently in a daze.

As the most glorious female student of White Deer Academy, receiving praises and admiration from all sides, she really had listened to too much, and also experienced too much. Almost all of the students of White Deer Academy viewed her as a high and mighty and cold goddess that overlooked the world of mortals. While she, as though she really was a goddess, looked at the majority of her peers with an indifferent and rejecting manner.

But don’t forget that, no matter how cold she was, she was essentially only a 16-year-old girl.

16-year-old girls yearn for love. Who doesn’t want a beautiful fantasy?

They had countless dreams about how one day they could meet their true love appearing on a rainbow cloud.

Unfortunately, she hadn’t met him yet.

Until the appearance of Ye Qingyu.

It can be said that Ye Qingyu, who had soared to the sky, no matter from which respect, all met the requirements that she had for her Prince Charming. But the problem was that, at the beginning, Bai Yuqing did not pay the slightest attention to Ye Qingyu, and although they were the students of the same Academy, they never had any interactions.

She never really knew him.

After some thought, Bai Yuqing felt a hint of regret, and a little ashamed. It should be said that as a senior sister, four years ago she came to a judgment that the arrogant and somewhat egotistical Ye Qingyu would not become a skilled master...

“To Snow capital?” On Bai Yuqing’s face, a strange expression emerged. “Then I’ll see you at Snow capital.”

After that, she finally turned away and left.

But Bai Yuqing did not see that, around the corner of the distant street, Ye Qingyu had not left, his footsteps came to a stop, as he saw another woman.

Another woman, appeared right in front of Ye Qingyu.

“Big brother Xiaoyu, can you forgive me?”

In the shadows of a tree in the corner, Jiang Xiaohan had tears streaming down her cheeks, and a look of guilt, looking at Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu did not speak.

Towards the girl in front of him, he also was not clear about what kind of feelings he had for her.

The scene of them playing together as kids would still emerge on his mind from time to time. To Ye Qingyu, that time, with his parents by his side, was the happiest time in his childhood. This period of time would flicker in Ye Qingyu’s mind, and the most important thing was that, during that period of time, there were many memories of Jiang Xiaohan.

It was impossible to say that he had no resentment or hatred for Jiang Xiaohan’s actions.

Ye Qingyu was not a saint.

Especially when it was in the competition against the Azure Phoenix Academy in the [Boundary Canyon Battlefield]. The worst was what Jiang Xiaohan said in the Heavens Pavillion. Her provocation had incited countless people’s poisonous thoughts. It had made Liu Yuancheng and Chen Moyun chase after him ------perhaps without Jiang Xiaohan’s provocation, a despicable person like Chen Moyun would still act. But Ye Qingyu reckoned that the death of the sentries could definitely be attributed in part to Jiang Xiaohan.

During his visit to Deer City this time, Ye Qingyu did not give Jiang Xiaohan a hard time, because when his parents were alive, they treated the little girl as their daughter, looked after her, and doted on her. She was also once a source of happiness to his parents.

But to forgive her?

Ye Qingyu smiled. “Junior sister Jiang, everything has passed, I also have nothing to say, I can just advise you one sentence: one will be punished for their many misdeeds. I also hope you would listen, and in the future restrain yourself, so as not to, because of fame and wealth, drown your own heart. As for the relationship between us... there is nothing to say. It’s better we didn’t meet.”

Once he finished speaking, Ye Qingyu twisted around, turned into a stream of light and disappeared in the sky.

Jiang Xiaohan stood in her original place, tears running down her face, looking aggrieved.

“I am already very sincere to beg for your forgiveness. I’ve thrown away all my self-esteem to beg for your forgiveness. Why, why are you still so heartless?”

She lowered her head and muttered.

“Silly girl, I already told you to not find the heartless man, do not weep for him.” A black mist-like figure appeared out from the shadows of the willow tree, the appearance was unclear and the voice was a chilling cold that sent a shiver down the spine. “Can you give up now? Still hesitating? Come with me, the world is huge, he’s just a little third rated military Marquis.”

“I...” Jiang Xiaohan was hesitant.

“Why are you hesitating? Now the heavens and earth have changed, the weather is upside down, the spell of good fortune of the Snow Country has run out, the sect era will resume. Our [Passionate Dao] was one of the ruler class sects in the age of sects. You have a special body. Under our sect, you will sooner or later stand at the peak of the martial path. At that time, when you hold everything in your hands, a little kid at the Bitter Sea stage, you can do what you wish to him.”

On Jiang Xiaohan’s face, there was a struggling expression.

Chapter 338:


339 - Wei City

This black shadow-like figure that was like a spirit had found her ten days ago. It was the sect leader of an ancient sect, the [Passionate Dao]. His power was definitely terrifying, and far exceeded Jiang Xiaohan's imagination. But the problem was that the blood and flesh body of this sect leader had long been destroyed, and only his consciousness remained behind. As for the [Passionate Dao], perhaps it had once been really terrifying. But Jiang Xiaohan had searched through countless texts in the library of White Deer Academy, but she had not been able to find any description of the [Passionate Dao]. It seemed like the sect had long been extinguished.

To enter in such a sect, it was unknown whether it would be fortune or disaster.

If it was previously, Jiang Xiaohan would not even consider such a proposal.

But the problem was that Jiang Xiaohan's situation had changed.

Because of Ye Qingyu, the entire White Deer Academy did not want to interact with her anymore. Those noble young masters who circled around her previously now avoided her like she was a centipede or a snake. If she continued to stay in White Deer Academy, it would be difficult for her to progress any further. The greatest hope of Jiang Xiaohan in these years was completely destroyed.

She was not willing.

She was not willing to become a normal girl after graduation. She was not willing to marry, to become a common wife, to bear a child, and not willing to age just like that, her entire life trapped in a little place like Deer City.

"What are you still hesitant about? The age of the sects is about to descend. The power of the [Passionate Dao] is something you cannot imagine. Your body is naturally perfect for the [Seduction Mantra] of our [Passionate Dao]. The mantra is split into nine parts. If you successfully cultivate to the first three stages, you can annihilate all the Spirit spring experts. If you reach the fifth stage,you can crush top level experts. If you are really fortunate enough to reach the ninth stage, then you can freely travel anywhere and do anything you want in this world. There is no one who can suppress you anymore in this world..." the voice of the sect leader sounded out beside Jiang Xiaohan, his voice filled with an endless seduction.

Jiang Xiaohan deeply breathed in.

"Fine, I accept."

She made her choice.

"Haha, that is the wise decision." The sect leader began smiling in satisfaction.

……

……

When it was morning, Ye Qingyu came to within the Azure Phoenix Province.

In the area ruled by the Snow Empire in Heaven Wasteland Domain, the region was split into eighteen different provinces. The Azure Phoenix Province was one of them. Compared to Deer City, it was nearer to the south, and therefore the greenery and shrubbery were more lush and verdant. It was mostly hills, but compared to the dangerous and massive Deer Mountain Range, it was much flatter and safer.

The sentry originated from a city called Weicheng within the Azure Phoenix Province.

He was the simple and common son of a merchant.

Previously, Ye Qingyu had already inspected the military documents held for this sentry and his family. He had a brother in his family, a sister, and his parents were still there. There was a merchant company, that was led by his brother within the city, and they could be counted as a well-off family.

When Ye Qingyu reached Weicheng City, the sky had began to turn bright.

The [Bright Sword Ship] halted ten miles away from Weicheng City.

According to the rules of the Empire, those military flying ships were not allowed within the city.

The [Bright Sword Ship] had only arrived an hour earlier than Ye Qingyu. Wen Wan had already sent people inside the city to prepare. They needed a pass to enter into the city for them. This place was already classified as a different province, therefore Ye Qingyu's influence was not as great as when he was in Youyan Pass or Deer City.

Ye Qingyu stayed in the flying ship. He rested for a while, recovering the inner yuan inside his body.

In less than an instant's time, the soldier that they had sent to prepare had returned. They had obtained the pass to enter.

"Let's go."

Ye Qingyu brought Ximen Yeshui as well as four Youyan Pass soldiers to leave the flying ship. They came to the Weicheng City. The soldiers guarding the city, after inspecting their pass to enter the city, finally allowed them through.

Weicheng City was not the most affluent city of Azure Phoenix Province, but it's scale was even larger than Deer City.

Because it was nearer the center of Snow Empire, it's environment was naturally better than Deer City. The resources were wealthier, and the city was incomparably affluent. People were everywhere. After they went past the city gates and entered the city truly, they could sense the luxuriousness of this city. Around on the stores of the streets, there were stands that constantly called out. There were many people that wore brocaded and luxurious clothes, clearly indicating the wealthiness of the people of the city.

Ximen Yeshui looked everywhere as he walked, eyes bulging out, a complete look of a country bumpkin.

“Mister, do you know how to get to Qinchun street?" Ye Qingyu asked an old man by the roadside that was selling pastries.

“Oh, after you finish walking this Qinhei street, and then Longchun street. After you go through the street at the end, you will have reached Qinchun street." The old man seemed to be around seventy years old, his head completely white. His clothes were somewhat shabby, and he was thin and gaunt. He held two bamboo baskets, sweat sheding from his forehead. He constantly painted, seeming to be expending a lot of effort.

He gave them a glance. Seeing that the aura of Ye Qingyu and the others were not normal, he did not dare ignore them and gave them clear directions.

Eh?

The moment that the old man lifted his head, Ye Qingyu could see a large scar on his head. Evidently, they had just stitched it up simply and it had not completely healed. There was a bloody line that was like a centipede between his left eye and left side of his hairline. From its appearance, it should be caused by a blade or a sword.

Ye Qingyu was surprised, but he did not ask further. Clasping his hands in thanks, he continued onwards.

After walking several steps, there was a commotion. Then it was the painful cries of the old man who had just led them the way.

Ye Qingyu frowned. Turning his head to look, he saw several muscular men wearing faint purple bodyguard outfits that surrounded the old man in the middle. They were punching and kicking him. There was also a middle-aged man who looked like a scholar with a long beard that stood at the side, cursing and shouting at the old man.

"Old bastard, the money you owe is already three days late. Just when will you return it? Where do you want to hide?" the middle-aged scholar cursed at him viciously. "I was about to go to your house to claim, but I met you midway... What, were you thinking of running away?"

"Manager Zheng, I... Please can you speak to young master Wu and say that I will definitely repay you guys in the next few days. I will definitely repay you guys. You've already taken everything of worth in my family away... I have to currently sell pastries to make money, I..." The old man had been stamped several times. But he could not pay attention to the pain. He lay on the ground begging."

"Selling pastries?" The bearded man gave a cold smile, then kicked the two bamboo baskets away. Tens of flatcakes instantly flew out, landing in the gutters nearby. "The tiny amount of money you earn from selling flatcakes, just how long will it take for you to repay your debt? Old bastard, stop struggling. Why don't you let your daughter enter into the Wu household, then that debt will be forgotten..."

The people on the roadside, seeing this scene, did not dare to stand out and object. The large majority of people saw this and pretended they did not witness such a scene, and quickly departed. There was a small number of people that had a pitying expression, but they held the rage in their heart without saying anything.

It seemed like this group of people had high status in Weicheng City.

From far away, Ye Qingyu frowned.

"Hehehe, is this the rumoured the strong bullying the week? I've read about this many times in novels, but it's my first time witnessing such a scene in real life. Hehehe, this is namely the time for you to act, and become a legendary hero..." Ximen Yeshui said excitedly.

Ye Qingyu stared at him, completely speechless.

He turned round and ordered a person called Gao Shou to stop this, and assisted the old man who had given them directions.

There were two bodyguards that wanted to fight against him. The result was that Gao Shou lightly brushed them away, and they were sent flying.

"Just what kind of bastard appeared that doesn't fear death, that they dare to spread fire here? To dare interfere in the matters of the Wu household?" The bearded middle-aged scholar screamed.“

"Owing a debt is owing a debt. Why must you hit someone?" Gao Shou was a fierce soldier that was born through a hundred battlefields within Youyan Pass. How could he be intimidated by a lacky? He lightly said such a phrase, and assisted the old man up. He picked up the bamboo baskets, and picked up the fallen flatcakes.

"Haha, just who do you think you are, to think you dare mess with me?" The middle-aged scholar sneered.

He was about to say something more, when Gao Shou eyes suddenly narrowed. A sinister killing aura emanated. The killing qi that was created from the demon battlefield where corpses were as high as mountains and blood ran till it became like a lake in Youyan Pass emitted from his body. The pressure was like were real, and shot towards the surroundings like blades. The complexion of the middle-aged scholar instantly turned deathly pale, and large beads of sweat dripped down. The bodyguards beside him were also shivering, like rats being held in place by a cat.

"I... I will definitely repay my debt. Manager Zheng, can you please say, I..." The old man who had given them directions stuttered.

The middle-aged scholar snorted, his face cold. He did not say anything, and left with his subordinates. Before he left, he turned his head around and gave the old man a glance. The viciousness in his eyes was enough to make one shiver.

After several people had left, the old man could not help but weep. Two lines of tears streamed down his face. Wiping away the tears, he bowed to give his thanks to Gao Shou who had extended his aid.

Ye Qingyu looked at the distance. He knew that this middle-aged manager would definitely not give up. This time, he did not know whether he had placed the old man in a worse situation by helping.

"You, secretly gather information. Find out just what sort of existence the Wu household is, and just how did the old man owe them money. Find an opportunity to repay it for him, and settle this matter." Ye Qingyu whispered instructions to Gao Shou who returned for further orders.

"Yes." Gao Shou went to carry out his orders.

"Such a matter, you can take care of it now, but you can't take care of it for the rest of your lilfe," Ximen Yeshui said in a low voice

Ye Qingyu smiled.

"If I see something unjust, I will unsheath my blade to help. Of course I have to interfere if it crosses my path, if it doesn't, then I can't do anything. I can only seek peace from my heart.

Ximen Yeshui slightly nodded his head.

In truth, Ye Qingyu had not said something extra. If everyone in this world would interfere in all the matters they witness, there would perhaps be much less incidents where one party bullied another because of their power.

After this little incident, the party continued on their journey.

According to what the old man had said, after passing through several little alleys, they would finally reach Qinchun street.

This was a glamourous street, and the stream of people was rushing. It completely did not fall behind to the main road of the city gate----

========================================

Chapter 339:


The family of the sentry was living at Qinchun street.
As one of the wealthier families, they had a certain position within Weicheng City. Therefore it was within reason that they lived on a bustling and prosperous street like Qinchun street.
As they followed the road to this place, Ye Qingyu looked around carefully.
The merchant company that the sentry’s family owned was known as the Four Seas Merchant Company. It was extremely famous throughout Weicheng City. There were three stores in this street that had the name Four Seas in it. This was the information that was obtained from the report of the military department. But for some unknown reason, on the way here, despite Ye Qingyu looking carefully at the stores on both sides of the street, he did not discover any stores with the name ‘Four Seas’ on it.
What was happening?
Could he have taken a wrong turn?
Ye Qingyu was somewhat confused. The other Youyan soldiers had also kept a lookout for these signs. Even if Ye Qingyu had missed something, the others would not have also overlooked it.
After watching to the end of the Qinchun street and walking through it again, they did not manage to find anything.
Could it be that the Four Seas Merchant Company had moved?
Or perhaps the information held in the register of the military department was wrong?
Ye Qingyu stood by the side, thinking it over carefully. He turned his head to looked at the weapons shop next to him. There was the owner who was wearing a head cloth that was currently seeing someone off. He was a fifty-year-old man, and seemed to have a genial face. He should have opened such a store for many years in Qinchun street. Ye Qingyu headed directly towards the weapons shop owner.
“Hey, Mister, come inside. Are you here to pick some suitable weapons?” The owner of the store waved to Ye Qingyu, warmly greeting him with cupped hands.
Ye Qingyu replied courteously and entered into the weapons store.
With Ye Qingyu’s current cultivation, the weapons of such a store would naturally not interest him anymore. However, he did pick some weapons without paying much care that were of an average price. After paying, he pretended to ask innocently, “Mister, I heard that the Four Seas Merchant Company was on this street. Where has it gone?”
The complexion of this owner of the weapon store completely changed. With alarm. “Why are you asking?”
Ye Qingyu’s heart skipped a beat. Seeing the owner’s expression, he instantly knew there was a story within this disappearance. Acting like he did not care in the slightest, “It’s nothing. It that’s previously I came to Weicheng and went to the Four Seas Merchant Company to buy something. This time I came again and discovered it was missing. Could it have been performing badly?”
“How could this be. Old Liao is very clever, he started from nothing. The Four Seas Merchant Company could be counted as famous in Weicheng and they were very able. How would it close? It’s only… sigh…” The owner of the weapon store suppressed his own voice. “Even if you are a clever and able person, without power or background, everything is like smoke in front of the rich and powerful…”
He said such words with a pitying and consoling tone.
There was definitely an incident that had occurred.
Ye Qingyu continued to ask on, “Do you mean that the Four Seas Merchant Company has offended someone?”
“Sigh, it’s a long story. This matter is complicated. The family of old Liao is in a pitiful state.His eldest son is currently imprisoned… This matter is currently the forbidden topic within the city. We cannot just say anything loosely. I can’t say anymore. Mister, I think that you are a person that cares, but don’t pry into this matter any further. Why don’t you have another look at the weapons? This sword is not bad, it’s the work of a master, do you want to have another look?”
The owner of the weapons store did not seem like he was willing to say another word.
Ye Qingyu nodded his head, comprehending in his heart. The owner of this weapon store was a insightful person, he was able to faintly guess his intention for coming here. He did not pursue this matter any further, and said with a sincere expression, “Thank you for reminding me. I know, but I only want to ask, where has Old Liao and his family have goneand how will I be able to find them?”
The owner of the weapons store evaluated Ye Qingyu seriously, his expression becoming hesitant.
“Don’t worry, I am Old Liao’s friend. I’m not a bad person.” Ye Qingyu smiled.
The owner of the store finally let out a breath of relief. suppressing his voice to it’s quietest, “You should be able to find them in Donkey Tail Alley… mister, it’s important to be honourable. But the trouble Old Liao has incited is troublesome, you had best not wrap yourself up in it.”
Ye Qingyu clasped his hand, “Thank you.”
Then he brought Ximen Yeshui and the others to depart.
The owner of the weapon store walked to the door, staring at the backs of Ye Qingyu and the others. Shaking his head and letting out another sigh, “Sigh, just what did they do wrong. What is wrong with the world? They only wanted to do some business, but their family was torn apart…
……
……
At Donkey Tail Alley.
It was the famous poor district of Weicheng, dirty and disordered. The Donkey Tail Alley, as well as the other seven alleys nearby, were known as the eight great alleys. It was like moss growing on the body of Weicheng City, it was a place where people kept their distance.
Ye Qingyu and the others appeared at the entrance to Donkey Tail Alley.
It was a little alleyway that was not even two meters wide. On the right side, there was a black gutter with disgusting water flowing in it, unknown substances swirling inside. There was a powerful stench of rot emitting from this black water. The surface of this alley was disturbed and bumpy, and everyone that passed by this alley was dressed extremely poorly. Bitterness was on their faces and all of them seem malnourished.
The family of sentry had moved into such a little alley?
According to reason, the sentries had died in battle and the Youyan army should have long reported this. The military department should have recorded this contribution down. Their family could be counted as the family of heroes. Even if they were not nobles, they should have received the protection of the government officials. Just who had the Four Seas Merchant Company offended, for them to be forced into such a state?
There was a trace of anger that gradually rose in Ye Qingyu’s heart.
“Go. Let’s go have a look.”
Ye Qingyu headed inside the little alley.
Ximen Yeshui curiously evaluated his surroundings, following closely behind.
The sight they saw was different from the people dressed in brocaded and luxurious clothing on the main street. This little alley was enough to satisfy any description of the poor. The two sides of the alleyway had rooms created by low walls made of coarse clay, as well as some tents made from beast skins. They could occasionally hear sounds of cursing and fighting, and there would occasionally be a flash of sunlight that shined into a corner. They would see old men their faces filled with numbness, or perhaps cripples with broken arms and legs. There were also muscular and rough men with sinister expressions that were dotted about…
The clothes that Ye Qingyu and the others wore were not fancy or wealthy. But in this alley, they were the odd ones out.
There were different gazes that constantly regarded them from both sides, curiously evaluating them.
The Youyan soldier beside Ye Qingyu went to enquire about, seeing if anyone knew where Old Liao’s family were. At first, no one paid any attention to them. But after giving a tael of silver, there were people fighting to lead the way. The large majority of them were conmen who had not even heard of Old Liao, and only came forward for the money.
In such an area where it was bitterly poor, there would be people killing and setting fire just for a little bun. All their gazes glimmered with light as they regarded the money offered to them.
As expected, there was a man that had a chest filled with black hair, and a blood red tattoo on his body that surrounded them from all directions.
“Little brat, leave the money behind, otherwise…” A burly man chuckled sinisterly.
But before he could finish, he flew out spitting blood.
Just how powerful were the Youyan soldiers?
How could they allow such a level of trash to be so impudent in front of the Marquis?
The other burly men’s expressions turned pale. They had not even seen their opponent act, before their comrade had fainted and vomited blood. They instantly knew they had met someone hard, and scattered like terrified mice.
“Lord, you said you wanted to find the Old Liao of the Four Seas Merchant Company?” There was a somewhat shy boy that finally mustered his courage.
Ye Qingyu heard his question, and knew they found someone who could help. He nodded his head with a smile at the boy.
“Are you Old Liao’s friend?” The little fellow asked with hesitance.
Ye Qingyu nodded his head.
“En, if you are his friend, then I can bring you to him. But he might be at home, there are only auntie Liao and sister Cui Cui there.” As the little fellow spoke, he led the way.
After following the little boy for fifteen minutes’ time, they took turn after turn. It was like entering into a labyrinth. The deeper they went, the more shocking the conditions became. Finally, there were not even rooms, but only little holes that had been dug on the ground, and weeds. There were also collapsed stone houses that had been constructed who knows how long ago…
“It should be here…” The little boy pointed to one of the Sogon grass houses. “Old Liao and the others, should be inside…”
Before he had finished.
Boom!
There was an explosion that came in front of them.
Wind swept everywhere. Accompanied by a sharp cry, as several grass houses collapsed.
There was a significant fluctuation of yuan qi in the air.
There were martial experts exchanging blows?
Ye Qingyu’s expression changed slightly. Because he could sense that, of the two colliding yuan qi, one of them was the Youyan soldier who he had hiddenly sent to follow the old man who had led the way.
Why would an expert appear here?
As he thought of this, they quickened their footsteps. Very quickly, they came to the place of conflict.The surroundings were completely chaotic. Five or six houses made of Sogon grass had collapsed. There were constantly people screaming as they crawled out from the wreckage. There was a person wearing a black-coloured battle robe, with anger in his face, that pointed at the old man that gave them directions as well as the two women he protected behind him.
And what faced them was the middle-aged scholar called Housekeeper Zheng. There was also twenty or so guards with him.
And the person who faced Gao Shou was a muscular man that was like an iron tower with a leather wrist guard at his wrist and arm. He had a sneer on his face. Cracking his wrists, there was a sinister and bloodthirsty expression on him.
“Little fellow, this is the matter for the Wu household. You dare interfere, You really don’t want to live anymore,” Housekeeper Zheng shouted loudly and sneeringly. Then he pointed at the old man who had led the way, his tone filled with threat as he said, “You bastard Liao, to think you would dare not repay your debt. So you had found help. Haha, to directly oppose the Wu household, you must be blind. let’s see how young master Wu will take care of your whole family. “
So the old man that was selling pastry and gave the directions was Old Liao.
He was the father of the sentry.
Ye Qingyu suddenly understood.
As they spoke, Gao Shou spotted Ye Qingyu and the others who had hurried over. he quickly came, and paid his respects. “Marquis, I’ve found the person in question. So the old man was the father of brother Liao. Their whole family, apart from brother Liao’s older brother who has been imprisoned, are all here.”
Ye Qingyu nodded his head.
He did not imagine that the family of the sentry had fallen to such an extent.
An acute sense of guilt and responsibility filled Ye Qingyu’s chest. If he was able to come a little earlier, perhaps there would not be such matters that had occurred. Then perhaps the Liao family would not have to suffer so much?
He had… really failed the sentry.
The family of the sentry was living at Qinchun street.
As one of the wealthier families, they had a certain position within Weicheng City. Therefore it was within reason that they lived on a bustling and prosperous street like Qinchun street.
As they followed the road to this place, Ye Qingyu looked around carefully.
The merchant company that the sentry’s family owned was known as the Four Seas Merchant Company. It was extremely famous throughout Weicheng City. There were three stores in this street that had the name Four Seas in it. This was the information that was obtained from the report of the military department. But for some unknown reason, on the way here, despite Ye Qingyu looking carefully at the stores on both sides of the street, he did not discover any stores with the name ‘Four Seas’ on it.
What was happening?
Could he have taken a wrong turn?
Ye Qingyu was somewhat confused. The other Youyan soldiers had also kept a lookout for these signs. Even if Ye Qingyu had missed something, the others would not have also overlooked it.
After watching to the end of the Qinchun street and walking through it again, they did not manage to find anything.
Could it be that the Four Seas Merchant Company had moved?
Or perhaps the information held in the register of the military department was wrong?
Ye Qingyu stood by the side, thinking it over carefully. He turned his head to looked at the weapons shop next to him. There was the owner who was wearing a head cloth that was currently seeing someone off. He was a fifty-year-old man, and seemed to have a genial face. He should have opened such a store for many years in Qinchun street. Ye Qingyu headed directly towards the weapons shop owner.
“Hey, Mister, come inside. Are you here to pick some suitable weapons?” The owner of the store waved to Ye Qingyu, warmly greeting him with cupped hands.
Ye Qingyu replied courteously and entered into the weapons store.
With Ye Qingyu’s current cultivation, the weapons of such a store would naturally not interest him anymore. However, he did pick some weapons without paying much care that were of an average price. After paying, he pretended to ask innocently, “Mister, I heard that the Four Seas Merchant Company was on this street. Where has it gone?”
The complexion of this owner of the weapon store completely changed. With alarm. “Why are you asking?”
Ye Qingyu’s heart skipped a beat. Seeing the owner’s expression, he instantly knew there was a story within this disappearance. Acting like he did not care in the slightest, “It’s nothing. It that’s previously I came to Weicheng and went to the Four Seas Merchant Company to buy something. This time I came again and discovered it was missing. Could it have been performing badly?”
“How could this be. Old Liao is very clever, he started from nothing. The Four Seas Merchant Company could be counted as famous in Weicheng and they were very able. How would it close? It’s only… sigh…” The owner of the weapon store suppressed his own voice. “Even if you are a clever and able person, without power or background, everything is like smoke in front of the rich and powerful…”
He said such words with a pitying and consoling tone.
There was definitely an incident that had occurred.
Ye Qingyu continued to ask on, “Do you mean that the Four Seas Merchant Company has offended someone?”
“Sigh, it’s a long story. This matter is complicated. The family of old Liao is in a pitiful state.His eldest son is currently imprisoned… This matter is currently the forbidden topic within the city. We cannot just say anything loosely. I can’t say anymore. Mister, I think that you are a person that cares, but don’t pry into this matter any further. Why don’t you have another look at the weapons? This sword is not bad, it’s the work of a master, do you want to have another look?”
The owner of the weapons store did not seem like he was willing to say another word.
Ye Qingyu nodded his head, comprehending in his heart. The owner of this weapon store was a insightful person, he was able to faintly guess his intention for coming here. He did not pursue this matter any further, and said with a sincere expression, “Thank you for reminding me. I know, but I only want to ask, where has Old Liao and his family have goneand how will I be able to find them?”
The owner of the weapons store evaluated Ye Qingyu seriously, his expression becoming hesitant.
“Don’t worry, I am Old Liao’s friend. I’m not a bad person.” Ye Qingyu smiled.
The owner of the store finally let out a breath of relief. suppressing his voice to it’s quietest, “You should be able to find them in Donkey Tail Alley… mister, it’s important to be honourable. But the trouble Old Liao has incited is troublesome, you had best not wrap yourself up in it.”
Ye Qingyu clasped his hand, “Thank you.”
Then he brought Ximen Yeshui and the others to depart.
The owner of the weapon store walked to the door, staring at the backs of Ye Qingyu and the others. Shaking his head and letting out another sigh, “Sigh, just what did they do wrong. What is wrong with the world? They only wanted to do some business, but their family was torn apart…
……
……
At Donkey Tail Alley.
It was the famous poor district of Weicheng, dirty and disordered. The Donkey Tail Alley, as well as the other seven alleys nearby, were known as the eight great alleys. It was like moss growing on the body of Weicheng City, it was a place where people kept their distance.
Ye Qingyu and the others appeared at the entrance to Donkey Tail Alley.
It was a little alleyway that was not even two meters wide. On the right side, there was a black gutter with disgusting water flowing in it, unknown substances swirling inside. There was a powerful stench of rot emitting from this black water. The surface of this alley was disturbed and bumpy, and everyone that passed by this alley was dressed extremely poorly. Bitterness was on their faces and all of them seem malnourished.
The family of sentry had moved into such a little alley?
According to reason, the sentries had died in battle and the Youyan army should have long reported this. The military department should have recorded this contribution down. Their family could be counted as the family of heroes. Even if they were not nobles, they should have received the protection of the government officials. Just who had the Four Seas Merchant Company offended, for them to be forced into such a state?
There was a trace of anger that gradually rose in Ye Qingyu’s heart.
“Go. Let’s go have a look.”
Ye Qingyu headed inside the little alley.
Ximen Yeshui curiously evaluated his surroundings, following closely behind.
The sight they saw was different from the people dressed in brocaded and luxurious clothing on the main street. This little alley was enough to satisfy any description of the poor. The two sides of the alleyway had rooms created by low walls made of coarse clay, as well as some tents made from beast skins. They could occasionally hear sounds of cursing and fighting, and there would occasionally be a flash of sunlight that shined into a corner. They would see old men their faces filled with numbness, or perhaps cripples with broken arms and legs. There were also muscular and rough men with sinister expressions that were dotted about…
The clothes that Ye Qingyu and the others wore were not fancy or wealthy. But in this alley, they were the odd ones out.
There were different gazes that constantly regarded them from both sides, curiously evaluating them.
The Youyan soldier beside Ye Qingyu went to enquire about, seeing if anyone knew where Old Liao’s family were. At first, no one paid any attention to them. But after giving a tael of silver, there were people fighting to lead the way. The large majority of them were conmen who had not even heard of Old Liao, and only came forward for the money.
In such an area where it was bitterly poor, there would be people killing and setting fire just for a little bun. All their gazes glimmered with light as they regarded the money offered to them.
As expected, there was a man that had a chest filled with black hair, and a blood red tattoo on his body that surrounded them from all directions.
“Little brat, leave the money behind, otherwise…” A burly man chuckled sinisterly.
But before he could finish, he flew out spitting blood.
Just how powerful were the Youyan soldiers?
How could they allow such a level of trash to be so impudent in front of the Marquis?
The other burly men’s expressions turned pale. They had not even seen their opponent act, before their comrade had fainted and vomited blood. They instantly knew they had met someone hard, and scattered like terrified mice.
“Lord, you said you wanted to find the Old Liao of the Four Seas Merchant Company?” There was a somewhat shy boy that finally mustered his courage.
Ye Qingyu heard his question, and knew they found someone who could help. He nodded his head with a smile at the boy.
“Are you Old Liao’s friend?” The little fellow asked with hesitance.
Ye Qingyu nodded his head.
“En, if you are his friend, then I can bring you to him. But he might be at home, there are only auntie Liao and sister Cui Cui there.” As the little fellow spoke, he led the way.
After following the little boy for fifteen minutes’ time, they took turn after turn. It was like entering into a labyrinth. The deeper they went, the more shocking the conditions became. Finally, there were not even rooms, but only little holes that had been dug on the ground, and weeds. There were also collapsed stone houses that had been constructed who knows how long ago…
“It should be here…” The little boy pointed to one of the Sogon grass houses. “Old Liao and the others, should be inside…”
Before he had finished.
Boom!
There was an explosion that came in front of them.
Wind swept everywhere. Accompanied by a sharp cry, as several grass houses collapsed.
There was a significant fluctuation of yuan qi in the air.
There were martial experts exchanging blows?
Ye Qingyu’s expression changed slightly. Because he could sense that, of the two colliding yuan qi, one of them was the Youyan soldier who he had hiddenly sent to follow the old man who had led the way.
Why would an expert appear here?
As he thought of this, they quickened their footsteps. Very quickly, they came to the place of conflict.The surroundings were completely chaotic. Five or six houses made of Sogon grass had collapsed. There were constantly people screaming as they crawled out from the wreckage. There was a person wearing a black-coloured battle robe, with anger in his face, that pointed at the old man that gave them directions as well as the two women he protected behind him.
And what faced them was the middle-aged scholar called Housekeeper Zheng. There was also twenty or so guards with him.
And the person who faced Gao Shou was a muscular man that was like an iron tower with a leather wrist guard at his wrist and arm. He had a sneer on his face. Cracking his wrists, there was a sinister and bloodthirsty expression on him.
“Little fellow, this is the matter for the Wu household. You dare interfere, You really don’t want to live anymore,” Housekeeper Zheng shouted loudly and sneeringly. Then he pointed at the old man who had led the way, his tone filled with threat as he said, “You bastard Liao, to think you would dare not repay your debt. So you had found help. Haha, to directly oppose the Wu household, you must be blind. let’s see how young master Wu will take care of your whole family. “
So the old man that was selling pastry and gave the directions was Old Liao.
He was the father of the sentry.
Ye Qingyu suddenly understood.
As they spoke, Gao Shou spotted Ye Qingyu and the others who had hurried over. he quickly came, and paid his respects. “Marquis, I’ve found the person in question.

He had… really failed the sentry.

Chapter 340:


341 - Today I want justice

The Wu residence was extremely well known throughout Weicheng City. The head of the household, Wu Boxiong, was famous. Apart from being the little brother of the City Lord of Weicheng, his eldest son was also one of the thirteen foster sons of the current Right Minister of the Empire. The names of the thirteen foster sons were known as the Thirteen cold-blooded eagles, and Wu Yan was one of the youngest. He was known as the [Crafty Eagle]. Even in the Snow Capital, he was famous.

The second son of the Wu household, Wu Xi was the previous young master Wu mentioned by the housekeeper. It was said he held an idle post within the City Lord's residence, and just took the wage of the Empire every month. But they had never seen him doing his duty in the City Lord's office, and he mostly stayed within his own residence. He had gathered a group of Jianghu experts, and just walked across everywhere and anywhere within the city, doing as they pleased. He had an accompaniment of a group of young masters, and was known as the [Number One Young Master of Weicheng City].

The Four Seas Merchant Company originally did not have any enmity with the [Number One Young Master of Weicheng City]. But it was a pity that the youngest daughter Liao Cui, had bumped into Wu Xi coincidentally. For some reason, he had taken a fancy to her, and wanted to take her back and make Liao Cui as her concubine. He wanted Liao Xiongyi to obediently send his daughter into the Wu household.

As the so called [Number One Young Master of Weicheng City], Wu Xi loved to harass the opposite sex. This was something he was famed for in the entire Weicheng City.

Apart from his main wife who he married due to his parents, he had married many concubines into the household. The majority of them had a horrible ending. Most of them were played with and then tortured to death. In just this one year, there were sixteen young girls that had died after being married into the Wu household.

Therefore, even if the Four Seas Merchant Company and Liao Xiongyi had an ambition of rising up through this connection with the nobles of the city, he would not be willing to send his own daughter into such a fire pit.

Going against the wishes of the [Number One Young Master of Weicheng City], meant that he would naturally receive a lighting-like retaliation.

The fall of the Liao family was naturally within reason since such a thing had occurred.

Such was the news that the Youyan soldier Gao Shou had heard of just a couple of hours ago.

Ye Qingyu had a dark face as he walked towards the old man who had led them the way ----in front of the father of the sentry, he gave him a bow filled with guilt. "Uncle Liao, I am brother Liao Tian's friend. I came from Youyan pass, and passed by Weicheng City .I came especially to visit you. I'm sorry I came late and caused you, your wife and your daughter to be bullied to such an extent."

The Liao Xiongyi who was covered with wounds was stunned.

Liao Tian was his second son, and was naughty since he was young. He was extremely active and loved to practice martial arts. He could be counted as having some success in the martial path, breaking into the Spirit spring stage ten years ago. He answered the enlistment of the Empire and joined the army. He was then allocated into the Youyan army and defended the bitter lands of the Borders. Apart from feeling pride, Liao Xiongyi also often felt fear for his son's safety. He hoped for the safe return of his son everyday, so that the family could reunite.

But it was a pity his nightmare had arrived.

In the past year, the news from the military department came. His son had died in battle, and Liao Xiongyi and his family had been plunged into a great sorrow.

Liao Xiongyi, as a result of this, fell greatly ill. Everything to do with the Four Seas Merchant Company was handed to his eldest son, Liao Ri.

Thankfuly, his eldest son was both wise and hardworking. In his hands, the Four Seas Merchant Company improved daily.

However, who would have guessed that disaster would befall them. In but a quick period of time, everything that the Liao family possessed dispersed into smoke.

If one was to say Liao Xiongyi did not have anger in his heart, this was impossible. After hearing where Ye Qingyu came from, and he was the friend of his second son, there was a glimmer of hope that flashed in his eyes. But in an instant's time, the light quickly dimmed away.

He knew the identity of his son in the army, he was only a normal sentry.

A sentry, how would it be possible for him to interact with any important person?

Furthermore, this person was so young. His attire was also common, so he must be a normal, minor soldier?

"Thank you, soldier. I appreciate your thoughts. It's only that... it is currently not convenient for us to receive guests. You've seen our family and the state we're in, quickly leave. " Liao Xiongyi bitterly smiled, giving them a signal not to interfere and quickly depart.

After all, they were the friends of his son, and they had come to pay him a visit. They must be honourable people, Liao Xiongyi did not want them to be dragged into this incident.

But---

"Go? Let's see if you'll be able to go."

Housekeeper Zheng had a sinister look on his face as he sneered. "So you were a group. You came from Youyan pass? Haha, a couple of brutes from the border, you want to interfere in the business of the Wu household. No one here can leave..."

Liao Xiongyi panicked when he heard this.

There was a girl that seemed to be around twenty years old that had terror on her face, and was guilt stricken .She walked out step by step, "Housekeeper Zheng, I... I accept your request. I'll go with you to see young master Wu. I'll listen to everything you say... I beg you... release my brother, and spare my mother and father."

In her palm, she gripped tightly onto a silver hairpin.

This was her very last weapon.

If she was able to use her own body as a bargaining chip and save the lives of her family as well as the friends of her second brother, then her life would not have been wasted. Since everything had been caused by her, then let everything be ended by her. If she could not choose the process of her fate, she would at least be able to choose the end of her fate. So what if her virginity was taken by a person like young master Wu who was a beast inside. At least she would be able to seek escape with the silver hairpin.

"Cui'er..." the old woman screamed.

"I don't agree." Liao Xiongyi bit his teeth.

"Hahahaha, a great touching scene between daughter and parents." Housekeeper Zheng sneered, his face filled with tyranny. The guards of the Wu household beside him also began chuckling along.

Ye Qingyu shook his head.

"Uncle, Aunty, Little sister. You don't have to care about the matters here anymore. Leave everything to me."

As he said these words, he turned around, and said in a low voice. "Capture this group of people. Don't even let one run away. Whoever resists, just kill them."

The four elite Youyan soldiers, including Gao Shou, loudly shouted their understanding of the orders.

In truth, these four people were already reaching the limits of their endurance.

Although they have never seen Liao Tian, they knew that this dead sentry was part of the Youyan army. He was their comrade. He was a hero whose spirit would not leave, he was a hero of Youyan. The Youyan army shared honour and disgrace together, every comrade was like their brother. Seeing the family of Liao Tian being humiliated like so, they longed to bare their swords and slaughter the trash in front of them. If not for the fact that Ye Qingyu had not given his orders yet, they would have long acted.

"You... what are you doing?" Housekeeper Zheng's expression changed, then began laughing sinisterly. "Just kill? Ha, you really are mad. To pretend to be something amazing in front of me, do you think I'm..."

As he spoke---

There was someone that had already acted.

The man that was like an iron tower with a nail guard protecting his wrist laughed loudly. Yuan qi fluctuated all around his body as he moved to block the Youyan soldier.

Xiu.

The light of the blade flashed.

Gao Shou mercilessly used his blade.

Blood spurted everywhere. The head of this iron tower-like man shot to the sky, blood spurting like a spring. when the head fell to the ground, it rolled in front of the feet of Housekeeper Zheng. His eyes were still open wide, his mouth also opened, not able to rest in peace.

He had no way of believing what had just occurred. That Gao Shou who had always been suppressed by him, how was it possible he turned so strong in but a moment's time?

He was not even able to block one of his moves.

Housekeeper Zheng and the others, seeing this, were already scared witless.

"Ahhhhh..." Housekeeper Zheng was like a mother hen that had been hurt, screeching.

The guards and servants around him were shaking all over, their faces deathly pale.

Ping!Ping!Ping!

Accompanied by low grunts, this crowd of people were kicked away by the Youyan soldiers. They fell to the ground, screaming. Someone wanted to run, but were sent flying back with a kick. There were also other people who held their weapons, wanting to resist, but they were all killed. No one was spared.

"Aaaahhhh, you guys are dead for sure. To dare kill people of the Wu household, you bunch of murderers, I can be sure that your fate will definitely be very tragic..." Housekeeper Zheng felt that his kneecap hadbeen crushed by a kick. He sharply screeched on the ground, constantly cursing and letting out threats.

Gao Shou walked over. He let out a kick accurately towards the mouth of Housekeeper Zheng.

"Peh!" Housekeeper Zheng felt that the bones around his face was nearly crushed. All his teeth in his mouth were broken, and he opened his mouth to spit out a mouthful of blood filled with teeth. He screamed, but he did not dare form any more insults.

At this time, even an idiot could tell that Ye Qingyu and the others had terrifying strength and their methods were vicious. They were not afraid of the Wu household at all.

“"Find someone that can still walk. Tell him to give the Wu household a message." Ye Qingyu's expression was calm as he said blandly. "Tell the so called [Number One Young Master of Weicheng City] to get here in fifteen minutes. I want him to bring a carriage and horse, to personally escort uncle Liao and his family out of Donkey Tail alley. If he is even late by one breath, I will take his life."

As they heard such words, the people surrounding them felt their hearts trembling.

Gao Shou and others had a face that this was completely reasonable.

They knew clearly just what sort of person their master was.

The head of the Military supply department Zhang San, as well as the Li Qiushiu, Zhao Shanhe and the others of the Three Sects and Three Schools. They were all people would dared to offend. Once you touched the inverted dragons scale of Marquis Ye, then you would definitely have misfortune befall him. A tiny little tyrannical young master in a minor little Weicheng City, to kill him must be like crushing a little ant for Ye Qingyu.

Gao Shou grabbed a servant that was shaped somewhat fat and had light injuries in comparison to the others. Grabbing him, he asked, "Did you hear the words of my master?"

"I heard, I heard..." The servant was so scared he nodded his head like a chicken pecking at rice.

"Then scram." Gao Shou threw him away.

the servant scrambled on the floor as he ran away.

Ye Qingyu thought for a bit, then said to Gao Shou, "Go to the prison of Weicheng City and help me find out where Liao Ri is imprisoned. Protect him well, to prevent the people of the Wu household from doing anything. If there is any change in the situation, you are permitted to use force. I want you to protect brother Liao Ri, no matter what the cost.

"I will carry out your orders," Gao Shou said with excitement as he replied.

The subordinates that followed behind a person like Marquis Ye could really do what they wished. They did not have to be wary of anything. As long as they were within right, they did not have to fear anything. This was definitely the state that the soldiers of the Youyan army who were used to killing yearned for the most.

Gao Shou's figure transformed into a bolt of lightning as he quickly departed.

Ye Qingyu turned around, his face becoming much more milder. Looking at the Liao family, “You don't need to worry. Since I've come, this matter will not be so easily finished like this. Brother Liao Tian once used his life to protect my life. At that time, I swore I would take care of his family. I will definitely get justice for you."
