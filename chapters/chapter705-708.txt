Chapter 705:


Chapter 723 - Seven Fingers Race
Inconspicuously following behind the [Savage Army Demon Race] contingent all this time was a half-imaginary and extremely strange figure that resembled a night apparition.
It was none other than Ye Qingyu.
He had by now silently reached within 200 meters of the cage.
He was ultimately still a little worried about the little girl and thus tailed along.
The peculiar actions of the experts had caught his attention. He  clearly saw that the young expert had observed something on the girl's arm and confirmed something.As a result, he began to wonder what secret could be hidden on her body.
Concealing his aura, he maximized his vision and looked toward the girl's arms.
It was only at this point that he noticed there was  something on her right arm.
A silver-colored common-shaped bracelet which was made from an unidentifiable material.
It hung loosely at her wrist, giving off a dazzling white mist.
If not for the white mist, this bracelet would probably not even be worth a small piece of common origin crystal.
However, the mist was not the same as that emitted by an expert or a formation.
It was more like a mark that contained the ancient power of a race.
Just as Ye Qingyu was wondering about the peculiarity of the white mist, the expert whose body was strewn with black vessels suddenly shouted at the tower from the midst of the contingent.
Ye Qingyu was shocked like never before by what he was shouting.
"Ge Ming! I know you're hiding in there, so don't think about trying to escape and come out!" The expert bellowed in a voice bursting with so much demonic power that even the mist surrounding the tower began to vibrate lightly.
The Savage Army Demon Race had set up noise-canceling formations all around the tower within one kilometer, and thus were not afraid that their voices would be heard by other people.They were not worried they would alert the other groups who were also hunting for the gambling demon that was Ge Ming. Unfortunately for them, they were distinctly heard by Ye Qingyu, who had tailed them at a close distance.
Ge Ming is hiding in this tower?!
Ye's heart skipped a beat.
To think that the [Savage Army Demon Race] had also come to find Ge Ming!
A smile appeared on Ye's face.
The 14th-placed felon on the top wanted list of the Alliance of Domains, whom I've been strenuously searching for, has actually been hiding in this tower? Haha, this is truly, as the saying goes, a case of finding something easily after wearing out one's sturdy shoes to find something.
He decided to restrain himself and see how things would unfold first.
In the distance.
Silence.
There was no response from the tower.
The black-vesselled demon expert seemed somewhat peeved.
He once again shouted as his demonic qi sent shockwaves, "Ge Ming, don't forget that the girl in the cage is the only other person left of your race. Your Seven Fingers race will be close to extinction if she dies! My patience is limited, so if you don't appear within three breaths of time, I'll chop her fingers off one by one and throw them at the tower!"
In the distance.
Ye Qingyu was ever more astounded.
This girl is of the same race as Ge Ming!
The Seven Fingers race?
The last one of them alive?
Many thoughts flashed across his mind, but he could not recall ever hearing of the Seven Fingers race.
Things were becoming ever more confusing.
The atmosphere outside the lofty tower became extremely cold and silent.
One breath.
Two breaths.
Ge Ming still did not appear.
It seemed that he had no intention of rescuing the girl of his race.
Ye Qingyu's inner yuan qi began to circulate as he stared at the only window on the tower.
If Ge Ming ultimately did not appear, Ye knew he would have to step in to prevent those mean and cruel demons from harming the innocent girl they were using as bait.
A touch of chilly mist glimmered faintly in his hand.
Three breaths.
The demon expert who shouted toward the wall grabbed a knife, which was half an arm's length and polished using white demon bone, from the void with his backhand and walked up to the cage.When he was near the cage, he waved his hand to indicate that he was going to cleave the arm of the shivering child inside.
Ye Qingyu was about to step forth and rescue the girl.
Just then, an unexpected turn of events occurred.
"Hold it."
A gentle voice sounded from within the tower.
The knife in the demon expert's hand stopped moving, while Ye Qingyu also forbore from taking action. Everyone looked toward the tower, only to see the high window being pushed open, and out came a flying strange, slender, and mist-like figure.
The next moment.
On the black rock surface below the tower.
The mist-like figure suddenly substantialized.
From amid the transparent mist stepped forth a tall and refined-looking man with a breezy posture and a delicate grace.
As Ye Qingyu's eyes fell on this person, he immediately recognized the latter as Ge Ming, the gambling demon wanted by the Alliance of Domains.
However, compared to the somewhat hideous and brutal image on the wanted portrait, the person in front of him appeared as cultured and elegant as a noble prince and carried a naturally dignified aura on his body.It was such that it was hard to associate him with the legendary compulsive gambler and massacrous villain at first sight.
On the ground.
"Hoho, I'd wondered who would be talking so loud. Turns out to be just a reckless bunch of Savage Army cubs." The man swept a glance across the crowd, looking indifferent and calm, as if he was taking an idle stroll in a courtyard and letting his thoughts wander.
Ye Qingyu could see the man clearly once he drew nearer.
With his amber-colored long hair tied behind his head, it could be seen that Ge Ming possessed dashing eyebrows that reached his temples, a high nose that looked like a mini mountain, and eyes which flickered a lapis-like luster. His aqua blue gown, made of silk and satin, were adorned with silver thread flower patterns that added to his dispassionate and elegant demeanor.
If the place was some other city street, one would have thought that he was an elegant prince who had just stepped out of a mansion.
However, the left sleeve of the figure in the mist was empty!
The Fourth Step Immortal Stage expert, Ge Ming, had lost an arm!
In the martial world, when one had cultivated to a transcendent stage, it would take only a moment of thought to regenerate a lost arm.
This was especially simple for a top-level expert who had attained the Immortal Stage like Ge Ming.
But, what power could be preventing him from doing so?
Ye Qingyu was a little puzzled.
Below the tower.
The red-bearded elder laughed instead of becoming enraged upon hearing Ge Ming's contemptuous remark, and said, "Hahahaha, such ravings. The mighty gambling demon of old has become a street rat hated by everyone, and has been hiding in such a wretched tower... Hoho, Ge Ming, these days of hiding haven't been pleasant, eh?"
"It has indeed been terrible, and annoying... that, quite often, a bunch of beasts or insects, too big for their skins, would come to disturb my carefree life." A poker-faced Ge Ming nodded his head as if he was having an idle chat with the red-bearded elder.
However, with slow but steady footsteps, he sauntered toward the cage.
Completely disregarding the presence of the other demon experts who were surrounding the tower, he kept his eyes fixed on the little girl in the cage and revealed a nonchalant smile on his face.
Upon seeing him, the girl's pupils shone with a splendor.
And, the bracelet on her wrist became ever more dazzling.
In the meantime, Ye saw clearly that Ge Ming, too, had seven fingers on his right hand.
It seemed that Ge Ming and the girl indeed belonged to the same bloodline and race. Moreover, judging from the shape of their fingers and the form of the former's yuan qi, they belonged to a water-based race.
Ye Qingyu made a general assessment.
Just then, a hundred-odd meters away from the cage, at the spot where Ge Ming was.
Four young demon experts blocked him off.
"Why, thinking about saving her? Hoho, you can't be naive enough to think you can take her away today, eh?" The bull-eyed demon expert sneered as he blocked in front of Ge Ming with his glimmering and greatly agitated body which seethed with a powerful tide-like vigor.
"Why can't I? Do you really think you have the strength to kill me and claim the bounty?" The latter cast a glance at every one of the experts and then revealed a disdainful expression as he shook his head gently, saying, "I'll advise you guys not to make things difficult for yourselves. Give her to me without any tricks and scram, this way I shan't kill every single one of you."
The young expert's face was visibly furious.
"You... Hoho, so arrogant even in the face of death! Die!"
He launched an attack.
His surging power seemed to cause apocalyptic chaos.
In the distance, the red-bearded elder and the black-vesselled one instantly began to attack.
Following behind them was a scholarly demon expert who was the tallest among the contingent, as well as another dozen-odd experts who were each at the Immortal stage or above. They coordinated faultlessly as they attacked in mysterious stances at the same time, making it obvious that they had come prepared.
Their encirclement of Ge Ming was well within the plans.
Given the latter's strength, none of them would be able to beat him in a one-on-one duel.
Therefore, they had prepared to attack as a group.
The effect of the bounty on the Alliance of Domains' top wanted list was completely different from that of the Black Demon Pool's bounty list.
Aside from receiving origin crystals and divine weapons as rewards, the entire race of whoever killed a wanted felony would thereafter be protected by the Alliance. That was why countless races of experts scrambled one after another to hunt and kill those felonies in spite of the great difficulty and danger.
Taking it easy on one side, Ye Qingyu concealed his tracks and observed the situation.
Ge Ming's strength was considerably higher than what was shown in the information that Ye had seen.
Several breaths later.
Ge Ming was able to cope easily with being surrounded by the dozens of demon experts. He pointed a finger in an extremely elegant fashion at the approaching figures who seemed unable to get up close to him.
A mist surged as soon as he pointed.
Although it looked soft and gentle, its power was actually extremely great.
A finger-sized hole was instantly perforated in the flesh of every demon expert who was struck by the mist.
These round holes flared up a glittering brilliance, as if they had been ignited by a transparent flame, that extended all over the body. If one did not break the affected body part off voluntarily, one's entire body would be burnt and evaporate within a few breaths.
Ye's heart skipped a beat.
Ge Ming's finger can directly ignite an enemy's body?!

Chapter 706:


Chapter 724 Waves of Regeneration


The way that this refined young gentleman raised his hand was full of style and bearing, resembling a painter lifting his brush to paint. Yet, a shadowy mist would travel in whichever direction he pointed at, as if he was the Grim Reaper performing a roll call. His targets would instantly begin to burn upon making slight contact with the mist, just like when kerosene met a spark...

This sight was simply too strange to behold.

Every one of his fingers was like a longsword on which mist formed.

If he fired his seven fingers all at once, a spectacular bright gloss would burst forth like a killing god stepping out from the sea world.

The dozens of opposing [Savage Army Demon Race] experts continually expended their demonic qi and broke off their limbs voluntarily to prevent the shadowy mist from entering their bodies. New functional limbs rapidly regenerated and helped to fire the experts' demonic power up to the maximum level.

Watching the fight from a distance, Ye Qingyu had already made several judgments.

The shadowy mist ignition skill which Ge Ming languidly exerted was probably an innate magical ability of the Seven Fingers Race. It was indeed remarkably powerful and contained a Dao essence that was near-Great Dao.

The history of the Seven Fingers Race was definitely not simple.

It probably had some connection to the Ancient Demon God Race.

After the time it took for an incense stick to burn off.

The battle situation became increasingly clear.

The demonic power of the young Half Step Immortal Step realm expert was running thin, having been expended on continuous attacks and self-regenerations.

Only the two elders, as well as a few other young Second Step  Immortal Step realm experts, continued to fight.

"I'd long reminded you guys that the bounty on the Alliance of Domains' wanted list ain't that easy to get. Even if that smelly old fart Tuozheng came, he won't be able to touch me." Ge Ming appeared to casually point in any direction as he revealed a jovial-looking smile on his face. "Scram now, and Heaven will be merciful. I'm in no rush to kill all of you, but don't blame me for being heavy-handed if you still don't know the time of day."

"Hahaha, you don't even know when Death's in front of your eyes!" The black-vesselled elder suddenly erupted with an extremely brutal black demonic power once more, saying, "A wanted criminal like you has no right to call the honorific name of His Highness, the demon king of my clan. You'll die today!"

"His yuan qi has been largely expended. He'll be ours to slaughter if we can just keep things going for a while longer!"

"Kill him!"

"Kill!"

Several young experts, too, circulated their demonic power once more as they charged toward Ge Ming.

In the distance.

Having been observing the situation all this while, Ye Qingyu had long figured out that although both sides were expending yuan qi, the disparity in strength between them meant that Ge Ming had taken the upper hand.

However, what baffled Ye Qingyu was that Ge Ming seemed to be pulling his punches against the attackers. Otherwise, these demon experts would not have lasted more than, and would have perished within, an incense stick's worth of time.

"Come, bring me that lass." Enraged, the red-beared elder knew that the contingent could not sustain for much longer. "Ge Ming, you'd best submit yourself for capture, or I'll chop off one of her arms... Heh heh, unless you don't care about her life, that is."

As he was speaking.

One of the experts brought the little girl out of the white bone cage and held a frosty bone knife at her neck.

Ge Ming's countenance changed faintly.

The red-bearded elder acutely perceived this change.

He felt assured in his heart.

Because this showed that Ge Ming indeed cared very much about the girl.

As a result, the subsequent plan should proceed smoother.

"Hoho, Ge Ming, still not giving up?" In a flash, the red-bearded elder arrived beside the child and sharply clasped her head with five fingers such that it would be crushed into pieces if he exerted the slightest force.

Ge Ming sighed when he saw this.

A shadowy mist power rose from his solitary palm and pushed back the demon experts. He was not going to hold back any longer.

"Hoho, the [Savage Army Demon Race] is certainly becoming even more promising. Their noble elder is actually using an innocent child as a threat. He's truly doing the race proud." As he looked at the red-bearded elder, a hint of anger finally surged in his eyes which had remained indifferent throughout, and his tone became filled with sarcasm.

The elder's face blushed.

As a renowned expert of great strength and status, it was indeed beneath him to employ such a method.

But he quickly switched his thoughts and got over the embarrassment, then said sneeringly, "Any method is fine when used against a vicious and evil wanted criminal like you, as long as it gets us your skull... Ge Ming, seeing as you were once also Heaven's pride, I propose that you take your own life now and, in return, we'll keep your corpse in one piece."

"Hoho, you think I'm a three-year-old kid? If I take my own life, Shui Xiu probably won't survive either. You people wouldn't dare to kill her only if I'm alive." Ge Ming poured scorn on the suggestion.

Hearing this, the elder was momentarily dazed before he gnashed his teeth and said, "I can guarantee you that she won't die if you kill yourself. I'll bring her to Sunrise City and find an ordinary family to raise her."

With a sarcastic look on his face, Ge Ming rhetorically questioned, "Is that so? You think I'll believe a despicable character like you?"

The elder's expression became that of embarrassment at once.

A hideous look emerged on his face as he snorted, "Haha, whether to believe it or not is up to you, but what other choice do you have? If you don't kill yourself, I'll slice her up piece by piece and see how long you remain stubborn for... Hoho, Ge Ming, haven't you loved gambling your entire life? Why not bet that I'll release this girl after you've killed yourself, or else... Heh heh, you make your choice."

With that, the elder clenched his five fingers a little.

His dagger-sharp nails lacerated the forehead of the girl, who thereupon revealed a painful look on her face as her twig-thin limbs spasmed violently.

Ge Ming's countenance showed further changes.

"Stop it... Alright, you win." He gritted his teeth, saying, "I hope you keep your word... My life for hers. She's still only an ignorant and harmless child, and won't ever be capable of taking revenge against your race. Let her have a peaceful life..."

With that, Ge Ming promptly raised his hand and slapped a palm onto his own forehead.

When they saw this, every present member of the [Savage Army Demon Race] revealed a tinge of delight on their faces.

The red-bearded elder was all the more overjoyed. He never expected Ge Ming to actually value the girl so much that he would willingly sacrifice himself... It seemed that the elder's plan had succeeded this time.

Amid the darkness.

Ye Qingyu was also stunned by what he saw.

In the rumors, Ge Ming was described as a wicked person who was fanatical about gambling and causing bloodshed, and as a vicious, sinister, and murderous evil demon. Yet, would such a person offer to end his own life for the sake of a young girl?

This incident did not tally with the rumors.

For a moment, Ye Qingyu did not know whether to act or not.

However, just as everyone was in a thoughtful state, they saw that the anticipated sight of Ge Ming's blood and brain fluids spurting out did not transpire after he slapped himself on his forehead. Instead, his entire being thumped to the ground and turned into a cloud of mist which instantly dissipated...

"Hahaha, you people are too green to bet with me. Go back to your mothers' wombs and be reborn."

Ge Ming's voice sounded in the void in a shifting and extremely strange fashion, as if he had become invisible.

Virtually at the same time, the young girl who was tightly clasped in the elder's palm, too, thumped the ground and turned into a cloud of silver mist which dissipated into the void.

"This..." The elder winced as he looked at his own palm and immediately understood. "The Seven Fingers Race's occult technique, [Shadowy Mist Doppelganger]? Oh no, we've been had... Quick, guard the white bone cage!"

It was only now that the experts woke up from a sort of dream.

Everyone looked toward the white bone cage.

Earlier, pretty much everyone, including the demon experts responsible for guarding the cage, was captivated by Ge Ming's performance such that they became oblivious to everything happening beside them. After all, the girl was already in the elder's grasp, but...

To their utmost horror, they only now discovered that the girl was actually still in the cage.

It was but a doppelganger that had been brought out.

At the very instant that Ge Ming had appeared from within the tower, he silently used a shadowy mist occult technique to create a doppelganger of the girl in the cage and conceal her true body. As a result, it was but this shadowy mist doppelganger which the expert had brought out at the very start.

This kind of technique could be called a bluff.

Ye Qingyu suddenly understood why Ge Ming was known as the gambling demon. A technique like this was too good at fooling the eyes and senses of other people. If one used it for gambling, the chips would never stop rolling in.

"Quick, stop him!"

The red-bearded elder bellowed furiously.

Countless [Savage Army Demon Race] figures bolted maniacally toward the white bone cage.

"Hahaha... too late." Ge Ming guffawed as he pointed his fingers casually.

"Ahhh...."

"Nooo..." Two demon experts who were guarding the cage were already in flames and thus were screaming in pain.

Ge Ming's movements were perfectly elegant, easy, and nonchalant. Passing his arm, which was shrouded in silver mist, directly through the cage bars, he instantly destroyed the Demon Race formations on the bars and carried the girl's real body out.

"[Savage Army Demon Race], I'll remember this grudge and come for you all in due course." With the girl in his arms, Ge Ming's now-immaterial body flickered several times as he broke away from the fight and shot like electricity into the darkness.

"Dammit!"

"Don't let him escape."

The red-bearded elder and the rest of the [Savage Army Demon Race] experts roared and bellowed.

The bird in their hands had flown away. This enraged them like nothing else could and was very difficult to accept.

It appeared that it was too late to give chase. Over these few years that he had spent on the wanted list, Ge Ming's escape abilities had attained such perfection that his body was fast and elusive. However, just as he was about to disappear completely...

Another strange change occurred!

Swish!

A sharp, jarring, and air-breaking noise rang out like booming thunder.

Shining in a golden brilliance, an arrow suddenly shot toward Ge Ming from several hundred meters away within the Black Demon qi.

More precisely speaking, it was headed mercilessly and murderously toward the young girl in his arms.

Chapter 707:


Chapter 725 - Two of Heaven's Pride


"What... who could it be?" Ge Ming's countenance changed wildly.

He instantly understood that he had just run into a genuine ace.

The arrow contained a strange power of laws which was way beyond anything the [Savage Army Demon Race] experts could have conjured. Moreover, instead of targeting him, it homed in on the girl in his arms. As a surprise attack, it was impossible to evade by now.

With no time for deliberation, he instantly tossed the girl high up. Subsequently, he worked up the shadowy mist power in his single arm and sent it charging toward the golden arrow with a point of his finger.

He had chosen to counter with force.

Boom!

A blare which shook the heavens was heard at the very moment that the fingertip collided with the arrow.

In the next moment, a terrifying power began to suffuse. Invisible bursts of qi radiated in every direction and dust whirled in the air as the surrounding buildings instantly collapsed like sandcastles. It was the very picture of the end of the world.

Amid the smoke and dust, the golden arrow could be vaguely seen to reverse its flight.

Ge Ming's figure, too, was sent flying backward and landed on the ground.

He forcefully operated his yuan power instantly upon hitting the ground. Spewing a mouthful of blood, he drew the girl in midair toward him until she returned to his side.

"Shui Xiu, are you alright?" There was a concerned look on his face.

Although there was an unconcealable terror in her eyes while abrasions covered her face and body, the girl nevertheless shook her head mannerly, saying, "Uncle, I'm fine. Don't bother about me... you're injured..."

He heaved a sigh of relief after confirming that she had only suffered superficial injuries.

"Uncle's fine." He gently caressed her hair to comfort her. However, an unprecedented somber expression appeared on his face.

He had indeed been damaged by the earlier blow.

And it was not a light injury.

The arrow contained a frightening power which jarred his only arm. Moreover, a weird golden mist remained within the wound on his arm even until now, eroding his flesh and causing a trail of blood to drip down his long aqua blue sleeve.

In the distance.

A voice ripped across the air and came surging.

"Hoho, hiding rat, I let you slip away the last time, but you ain't going anywhere this time!" The voice, which contained a king's arrogance and a menacing vigor, resounded through the street.

Amid the darkness.

Ye Qingyu, who had originally prepared to intervene, reverted to concealing his tracks.

A new ace had arrived.

Who could it be?

He looked toward the direction which the voice came from.

Meanwhile, the men and horses of the [Savage Army Demon Race] caught up and once again surrounded the duo.

Two figures flew out from the Black Demon qi in the distance.

The first to emerge was a young man who looked somewhere in his twenties or thirties. He had a hard and resolute face, trimmed sideburns, jade-white skin, and wore a purple crown. An awe-inspiring, hawk-sharp expression gleamed in his black pupils, while his pale blue gown, which was inlaid with a yin-yang fish pair pattern, gave off a continuous whistling sound. He appeared to be lofty, aloof, and of an overbearing spirit.

Behind him was another man of similar age. His body was tall, upright, and dressed in a black robe on which a bright crescent moon was stitched using golden thread, while his black hair, which intertwined with the Black Demon qi, was bundled up by a golden crown. His facial features were profound and well-defined, as though they had been carved with a knife. Handsome brows slanted into his temples, while a hint of callousness and audacity could be seen in his black pupils.

As if they were two ancient divine mountains towering in the void, the two young men stood tall in midair alongside each other with deep and surging vigors, delivering a heart-palpitating oppressive force which was matchless in power and horror.

"It's those people from the Divine Sky Sect and the Black Moon Divine Palace!" The red-bearded elder recognized their clothing with one look and was shocked.

He immediately motioned to the other elders and demons, who were busy surrounding Ge Ming, to retreat to one side.

Although the [Savage Army Demon Race] could be considered an established force in the Vast Thousand Domains, it was considerably weaker than forces such as the Divine Sky Sect and the Black Moon Divine Palace. Besides, it was apparent that the young men who suddenly appeared were extremely powerful and high in status within their respective sects.

Seeing as these Higher Domain top-level large sects were intervening in Ge Ming's affair, the [Savage Army Demon Race] knew that it had to slow down and think things through in order not to cause unnecessary disputes.

In the distance, the covertly-observing Ye Qingyu also looked fearful.

The two young men who popped up were very strong and could not be underestimated.

Ye Qingyu quickly and correctly guessed their statuses from their clothing and adornments. He had always paid great attention to the Divine Sky Sect, and thus had taken note of their fashion in the Black Demon Pool's administration hall and the Clear River Domain's Immortal God Emperor Sect earlier on. This was why he knew that the young man in front was from the Divine Sky Sect with one look at the latter's clothing.

The dress style of the Black Moon Divine Palace was also one of its kind and easily recognizable among the entire Vast Thousand Domains.

"If my guess is right, this white-robed young man is Lu Li, the promising talent who is said to have gone on a killing spree in the [Easy Wins Joint], and if so, the black-robed expert next to him is definitely Yang Wanqu, the young Heaven's pride of the Black Moon Divine Palace."

Using his quick wits, Ye Qingyu swiftly figured their identities out.

It was totally unexpected that these two people would suddenly appear at this crucial time, adding a new obstacle to Ge Ming's originally flawless rescue plan.

Presumably, they were also in hot pursuit of him.

Ge Ming really has enemies everywhere, it seems.

Hiding in a dark spot, Ye Qingyu decided to quietly watch the situation unfold.

Below the tower.

Ge Ming's breath gradually steadied.

He frowned slightly as he looked at the two talents in front of him, saying, "As they say, ghosts never go away. Seems like there are truly a lot of idiots out there trying to claim the bounty on my head."

Facing him.

A hint of disdain flashed across Lu Li's pupils as he snorted and taunted, "Ge Ming, you think too highly of yourself. That price on your body doesn't interest me at all. The only reason for hunting you down is because you displeased me. In my world, anyone who displeases me must die!"

"That's right, nobody who provoked us has ever lived for a day longer." To one side, Yang Wanqu spoke haughtily, "It's most unfortunate that you've run into us. Blame it on your luck for provoking people you shouldn't have."

Ge Ming laughed upon hearing this.

"Tut tut, so many young people nowadays think themselves Heaven's proud talents, but don't have the strength and temperament to back it up. They can't even take a loss in gambling, and refuse to acknowledge that they've been outplayed. Not only are they shameless, but they insist on killing the innocent people who saw what a joke they were. The people in the [Easy Wins Joint] were truly unfortunate to have run into characterless scumbags like you two..."

With that, he turned his head toward the red-bearded elder's contingent and said with interest and humor, "Elder Chi Lie, these kids are blocking your path to wealth. You may want to kill me, but so do these shithead Heaven's pridelings. Hoho, I'm but one person, what are you gonna do?"

When the elder heard this, he became somewhat uncertain.

Hunting Ge Ming down had cost them a lot of time and energy. Now that he was close at hand, there was definitely a chance to make him surrender if the contingent could wear him down for another half a day or directly threaten him using the little girl.

Unfortunately, the arrival of Lu Li and Yang Wanqu had added new variables to the plan. The Divine Sky Sect and the Black Moon Divine Palace were both super forces in the Vast Thousand Domains, particularly the former, which was the hegemonic sect of a Higher Domain. The [Savage Army Demon Race], which was relatively inadequate, would certainly not want to go up against them.

"Ge Ming, you're a felon wanted by the Alliance of Domains, and so there's no place in the world for you. No matter who takes action, they would be helping the Alliance to eliminate evil." Chi Lie's countenance became frosty. "Since Master Lu and Master Yang intend to kill you, the [Savage Army Demon Race] will naturally step aside and not interfere."

Having hesitated for a moment, he had reached a decision inwardly.

As he spoke, he beckoned gingerly with his hands, and thereupon the entire contingent retreated to the periphery.

However, the duo did not show any response to the gesture of the [Savage Army Demon Race].

To them, things had simply happened as they should have.

The contingent was simply looking out for itself. Otherwise, the duo would not have minded massacring the lot of them.

In the middle of the grounds.

"Hoho, as they say, you toady knee benders have a thief's heart but not a thief's guts... To think that a bunch of veterans would be scared off by two young arrogant juniors. Hoho, the [Savage Army Demon Race] is as good as destroyed with you cowards in charge!"

A watery mist power emitted a bright luster that wrapped around his body.

An overbearing power radiated in all directions.

"Hoho, the desperate fight of a trapped beast? Reckless things certainly don't know how to give up." Yang Wanqu's face turned grave as he sneered, "I'll chop you into pieces today."

With that, he clenched his fist in the void behind him.

Ripples undulated.

A crescent moon-shaped golden machete appeared out of thin air.

Its surface was engraved with strange ancient rune marks which emitted a blood-colored luster. The golden radiance from the power of laws on the blade could not be looked straight at, and even forced the surrounding Black Demon qi half a meter back. This was absolutely not a common-grade weapon.

Just then, Lu Li swept a glance across Ge Ming and noticed the young girl clinging on tothe latter's sleeves nervously. A sinister look flashed across his eyes as he laughed blandly and said, "Ge Ming, you may not be afraid of death, but is that also true for the little girl beside you?"

The latter's countenance changed crazily at once.

The girl was his sore spot and also his Achilles' heel.

He knew full well that it was practically impossible to protect Shui Xiu in the face of these two Heaven's pridelings who came from super sects and forces even if he was at the peak of his strength, let alone in his current state and strength.

Chapter 708:


Chapter 726 - Who Goes There?


Lu Li and Yang Wanqu clearly saw Ge Ming's reaction.

The latter held back his impulse to act.

He partially understood what Lu Li meant - that it was better to slowly torture Ge Ming on a spiritual level. As he recalled the latter's indifferent and arrogant behavior toward and complete disregard for the both of them, he realized that a swift, fatal blow would only be too kind. Instead, it would be much more interesting and meaningful to attack him psychologically.

"I'm not related to this little girl..." Ge Ming murmured.

"Hoho, you think we're fools?" As Lu Li laughed grimly, a malicious aura gave his originally handsome face a chilling hideousness. "Who was it that risked his life to rescue this little bitch earlier? You aren't related? Hoho, when did Ge Ming become a vigilante for strangers?"

Ge Ming's countenance became gloomy.

"She's only a child," he said, enunciating each word.

"Yeah, but she's not that young... Hoho, given her age, I can sell her to a brothel in the seventh zone, whereupon all she needs is a little clean up before she starts entertaining guests." Lu Li's ghastly smile was like that of a crazy devil.

Flames of anger burned in Ge Ming's eyes. "Who could imagine that a successor of the Divine Sky Sect would say this sort of thing? I've never met anyone more shameless than you."

Lu Li guffawed. "I do whatever I want as long as it gives me a thrill. This place is a land of chaos, after all. Who's there to hold me back?"

Ge Ming was exasperated.

However, Lu Li suddenly said in an alluring tone, "If you kneel and kowtow in front of me and beg loudly for mercy, I may consider sparing this girl's life after torturing you to death."

"Are you serious?" Ge Ming asked in a bleak voice.

At this stage, he was like a wild beast who had fallen into a trap, and thus had no choice but to take a gamble.

"Of course." A subtle, bizarre smile arched at the corners of Lu Li's lips.

"Alright. I'm willing to do anything as long as you let her off." Taking two incomparably difficult steps forward, Ge Ming looked as if he was struggling with indecision, but eventually, he slowly went down on his knees at a meter's distance in front of Lu Li and said while revealing a hint of sadness on his face, "I beg..."

Lu Li and Yang Wanqu exchanged glances, each revealing a contemptuous and smug smile.

However, just then, Ge Ming's pupils flashed underneath his long hair.

He gently drew a stroke in the air using the index finger of his single arm.

A light and traceless water mist cut through the void and charged at an extreme speed toward Lu Li's knees.

The smile on the latter's face froze at once.

Sensing danger, he operated his bodily yuan power to its fullest and instinctively moved out of the way.

However, he was half a step too slow.

Upon being struck by the mist, a fingernail-sized flame was instantly kindled on his knee.

"You... are courting death, ughhhh," he grunted as flames of fury spurted from his eyes. Afraid to be negligent, he used a finger as a sword to cut off the flame on his knee together with some flesh, so as to prevent the power of the mist from entering his body.

This unforeseen event greatly surprised everyone.

With a playful look and a derisive sneer on his face, Ge Ming stood on the spot and gently raised his eyes.

Kneading three fingers together, he gently wiped the dazzling water mist on his fingertip as he plainly said, "That was for the arrow you surprised me with earlier... Besides, do you really think I'll believe a person of lowly and sub-bestial character, who would even renege on a bet at the gambling table?"

"Good, good, very good." Lu Li was angry to the point of madness.

He had intended to play with his adversary, but was instead taunted, sneak attacked, and even injured by the latter.

"My plan was to kill you swiftly, but that has changed. I shall keep you breathing while I slowly torture you... and even let you see me shaving the flesh and grinding the bones of the little girl until she dies a most humiliating death!" Lu Li's murderous spirit burst forth as a malicious and vicious flare burned in his pupils.

"Let's do it." Yang Wanqu grunted.

The duo took the initiative at the same time.

Pairs of yin yang fish shadows streaked forth in a purple aura as they exerted their palms repeatedly.

The surging energy within these pairs yin-yang fish comprised of not only an Immortal Step realm expert's yuan qi but also a tinge of an extremely ancient and overbearing force.

The golden machete spurted dozens of moonlight splendors which shifted in position according to Yang Wanqu's will. Soon, they formed into a circle that confined Ge Ming within.

"Hahaha, time to die!" Ge Ming looked up to the sky and uttered a long howl.

By drawing a circle on the ground, he created a formation which protected Shui Xiu within. Subsequently, he leaped into the one-versus-two duel. His fingertips continually shot streams of water mist in varied directions. As if they coagulated into a slender water sword, these streams not only pierced through the moonlight splendors and fish pairs, but also lacerated the void.

A battle began instantly.

Terrifying waves surged in the void.

Several breaths later.

The situation gradually became clear.

Although, given his strength, Ge Ming should easily be able to compete with one of these two young talents, he was fighting one versus two after all, and the wound on his arm was continually being corroded by a dark force hiding within. Moreover, his yuan qi was being rapidly depleted, and a pool of blood with extremely pure yuan qi had already accumulated on the black rock on the ground.

His countenance was starting to turn ghastly pale.

He was gritting his teeth and persevering strenuously.

"Are you curious why the wound from the arrow still hasn't healed?" Yang Wanqu looked on with a cunning and bizarre expression.

"I advise you to save your efforts and stop resisting. Even if we don't do anything, the Divine Sky Sect's [Thousand Souls Arrow], coupled with the Black Moon Divine Palace's [Heart Devouring Rune], will ensure you don't live past tomorrow. Hahahaha!" A hint of elation appeared in Lu Li's sinister eyes.

Indeed, a short while later.

Ge Ming looked increasingly pale. The arrow wound on his arm had already expanded to the size of a palm.

The crescent moon splendors and shadows surrounding him had already broken the water mist on his body apart and rendered him unable to move.

Like ancient divine mountains, the purple aura fish pairs blasted toward Ge Ming with majestic vigors.

Although the latter did his best to resist, he was sent flying by the force and spewed blood from his mouth.

Turning his head to look at the girl, he said in a gentle and warm voice, "I'm sorry, Shui Xiu... Uncle has done his best!"

Within the tiny formation.

Shui Xiu, who had been watching Ge Ming earnestly with a worried look all this time, nodded her head somberly. A faint smile appeared on her babyish and feeble face as she said, "Uncle, Shui Xiu isn't afraid... We shall go underground and find Grandpa, Grandma, Aunt, and my brothers and sisters... Uncle, I heard that the road to the netherworld is very desolate. Shui Xiu will follow behind you, so don't forget to pull me along..."

Below the tower.

"Hahaha, what a touching farewell..." Lu Li laughed maniacally as he tightened his palm, causing a beam of purple light to shine on it.

Yin yang fish pair shadows gradually appeared, each containing an even more terrifying power than those of earlier.

Already nearly out of gas, Ge Ming seemed as if he could hardly sustain any longer.

No more time to wait.

Ye Qingyu's pupils flashed in the distant darkness.

The next moment.

With just one thought, Ye Qingyu changed his figure and appearance in an instant.

Swish.

An air-breaking noise rang out.

In ghost form, he arrived a meter away from Lu Li.

He slammed a palm forth.

A silver dragon roar was heard as a chilly radiance developed.

In front of him.

"Who goes there?" Lu Li felt his vision blur and heard a mountain-toppling roar. Greatly alarmed, he responded as fast as he could.

He exerted a palm too.

Bam!

The world trembled as a huge boom sounded.

The power of the purple aura fish pairs collided head-on with that of the icy true dragons.

The impact destroyed everything in its vicinity and instantly raised a sky-high Black Demon sea out of the Black Demon qi, thereby shocking the entire 15th zone.

Astonished expressions flashed in the eyes of both Ye Qingyu and Lu Li at the very instant of the collision.

They felt the horror of each other's strength.

Their figures were sent flying backward.

"Who are you? How dare you ruin my plans!? Do you have a death wish?" Lu Li berated loudly as his figure stopped in midair and then attacked at an even faster speed than before. With a frightening vigor, he exerted a palm once again and shouted angrily, "Die!"

"Hahaha, what are you? Scram!"

Ye Qingyu's altered voice sounded like the rolling and surging ripples of the void in the Ninth Heaven. Without the slightest bit of fear, he also smashed a palm forth.

Lu Li was sent flying once more.

Making use of the feedback force, Ye Qingyu's figure turned into that of a most elegant dragon. He instantly arrived beside Yang Wanqu and punched the latter's golden machete with a magnificent and irresistible power which sent the Black Moon Divine Palace successor flying.

"Dammit... who exactly are you? How dare you protect a wanted criminal, in defiance of the Alliance of Domains! Based on the law, your punishment will be equal to his!" Similarly furious, Yang Wanqu fought back and dished forth several moonlight splendors.

"Funny. You're but a puny Black Moon Divine Palace dog, how dare you represent the Alliance of Domains? A frog in a well who doesn't know its limits like you had better scram!" Deliberately acting insane, Ye Qingyu clenched his fist behind him in the void, causing a huge ice knife to appear. With a power as great as Heaven's wrath, the knife struck Yang Wanqu and sent him flying.

At the instant when Ye Qingyu had decided to take action, he had already activated the [Limitless Divine Way], allowing his strength to skyrocket. The creation of the ice knife was meant to prevent his identity from being recognized right away. His current state had reached a peak, such that he held a great advantage and could afford to take liberties. Within a few moves, he completely suppressed the two Heaven's pridelings.

Watching the fight from a distance, the [Savage Army Demon Race] was utterly astounded by this sudden change out of nowhere.

They had thought that Ge Ming was certain to die with the appearance of the two Heaven's pridelings. Nobody expected the situation to abruptly change with the sudden arrival of a strange person who was frighteningly strong and as vigorous as a mad tiger. Moreover, he completely suppressed the two Heaven's pridelings... Who could this be, and how could he be this terrifying?
