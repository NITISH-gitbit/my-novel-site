Chapter 13:


Chapter 13 – Song Xiaojun

Her gaze swept across the large amphitheatre and coughed, saying, “There are still five minutes till the end of the class, I’ll talk a little more with everyone. At the time of my self-introduction I forgot to mention, my name is Wang Yan and I am currently the head teacher of the first years. I believe in the upcoming days, I will interact with you a lot…”

Just as she finished speaking.

Boom!

The entire amphitheatre was as if it had just been attacked by an invisible bomb, the entire atmosphere turning explosive.

Students who were originally snoozing were dumbfounded.

“What? The head teacher of the first years?”

“Heavens, such an ordinary female teacher… is really the head teacher?”

“I’m dead, I’m dead, I dared to sleep in the middle of a class the head teacher personally taught…”

“Damn, I must have left a bad first impression on head teacher Wang Yan, this is not good…”

“I should have seriously listened in this lesson. Head teacher Wang Yan personally describing the stages of body strengthening is an extremely rare occurrence. Even those noble families in the city may not receive the same treatment!”

The students did not even think that the teacher who was like a middle-aged housewife, was actually the strongest expert for the first years. Thinking back to their previous actions, everyone was suddenly remorseful and filled with regrets.

Ye Qingyu was also slightly taken aback.

Who would have thought that such an ordinary looking teacher would possess such a high position, even higher than the great teacher Hon that he saw.

But why did she appear so normally, and teach such a normal lesson?

According to her position and status, she was at least an expert in the upper level of the Spirit spring stage. This type of expert was definitely in the top ranks of Deer City. Her appearance and clothing was so normal, it nearly made peoples eyeballs pop out.

On the platform, Wang Yan continued —

“Through this lesson, I’ve reached a better understanding of everyone. This lesson is the first collective lesson that we will do, and is also the only lesson we will do in the upcoming month. This is because in the upcoming month, after this lesson, people will be separated into different groups. After all, the foundations of everyone is different, White Deer Academy will teach according to the student.”

The voices in the amphitheatre disappeared.

Every student silently and seriously listened to Wang Yan’s words.

No one dared to show the slightest neglect.

Dividing the class into different groups had long been predicted by Ye Qingyu. Those little geniuses from wealthy families already possessed a sturdy foundation and did not need to learn any more. By teaching according to the weaknesses of each student and adjusting the content, only in that way could you teach effectively.

“However, there is still an extremely important announcement that I will have to make here – Because of the battle between the ten academies that will happen later this year, I will select ten students that I will personally teach,” Wang Yan said slowly.

Her eye swept across the students below her, sparks of light appearing in her eyes.

At this time, she gradually demonstrated the respect a head teacher commanded. Her body seemed as if it had grown larger saying, “Originally I was slightly hesitant about the list of students, but after this lesson and seeing everyone’s performance, I have reaffirmed my selection.”

Pak!

Once these words were said, the still silence of the amphitheatre was broken and replaced by the heated discussions.

Similar training grounds like White Deer Academy existed in Snow Country. There were nine other academies and together they were known as the [Ten academies].

Every year, between the academies, a match would be held that was known as the [Glorious Battle of the Ten Academies].

This battle would concern the distribution of resources among the academies so it was extremely important. It was also an event that received great attention from many young geniuses. Many experts worshipped by many as idols in Snow Country emerged in the [Glorious Battle of the Ten Academies] and became famous through this.

In these years, White Deer Academy produced not an inconsiderable number of geniuses, but their performance in the [Glorious Battle of the Ten Academies] had always been less than ideal.

In this year’s selection for first years, rare geniuses like Qing Wushuang, Yan Xingtian appeared. This was regarded as the most exceptional class in decades so the academy placed great expectations upon them.

Wang Yan as one of the six heads of the academies, decided to use her position as head teacher to personally select ten students that she would carefully cultivate. And, in the [Glorious Battle of the Ten Academies] one year later, completely change their situation and making White Deer Academy respected once more.

Under such a situation, one can imagine exactly how lucky the ten students that would be selected were.

They would receive the greatest amount of attention from the academy, and would also receive the personal teachings of an expert like Wang Yan. This kind of treatment was extremely rare to encounter. Disregarding the inexperienced students of the first year, even geniuses from the upper years would crack heads to obtain such an opportunity.

Once you entered this list of ten, you were basically placed on a shortcut to becoming an expert.

After hearing Wang Yan’s announcements, all the boys and girls began chatting excitedly.

From their perspective, they had a feeling that their fate was about to be decided.

Countless eyes stared fixatedly at the stage, their eyes staring heatedly at the middle-aged teacher who was previously disregarded by them. If not for the classroom rules, there would already be numerous boys and girls jumping up and shouting, “Pick me, pick me, pick me…”

Only a few students had a confident smile on, sitting in their seats peacefully without the slightest impatient.

They were confident that they would definitely be on the list of ten.

“Silence,” Wang Yan spoke.

The large amphitheatre abruptly became so quiet that you can hear a pin drop.

She nodded her head, about to announce the results when an unnoticeable current of air passed near her ear. Wang Yan’s expression changed slightly, widened her lips then gave the students a glance, saying, “The list of ten will be announced by my teaching assistant.”

Saying this, she left in a rush.

After roughly ten breaths, another figure appeared on the stage.

It was a girl with a dress as white as snow.

The girl looked to be around thirteen or fourteen, wearing the fourth year swordswoman dress of White Deer Academy. Without any make up applied, her skin was like white jade, her collarbone exquisite, her face like from straight out of a painting. Walking up the podium she was like a fairy that appeared from the moon.

At this time, the gazes of countless boys were fixated on her.

Ye Qingyu also felt his vision brighten up.

From the girls he had seen, just judging by appearance, this girl with a white dres definitely could be placed in the top three.

But this young woman’s atmosphere was slightly too cold, as if she was an ancient icy mountain. Even just by giving her a glance, you would feel as if your soul was about to be frozen.

The general temperament of such a person, would have arrogance and conceit in their very bones and not be easy to make friends with.

Wang Yan’s assistant, was also not a normal person.

“My name is Bai Yuqing, a fourth year. Head teacher Wang Yan has some business she has to take care of, allow me to replace her in announcing the list of ten.” Bai Yuqing stood on the stage, and calmly said, “Those who hear their own names, please come up on the stage and let everyone see you.”

After these words were said, the temperature of the entire amphitheatre seems to have dropped by several degrees.

Several people cried.

“So she’s Bai Yuqing!”

“The number one goddess of White Deer Academy!”

“The rumours do not lie!”

“I hear that her strength, also lies in the top of the ranking in White Deer Academy. Possessing a bloodline inheritance, she has already garnered the attention of several big sects. If not for her insisting to complete the entire four years at White Deer Academy, she would have long graduated!”

“No wonder she is the girl that has attracted the gaze and attention of everyone, she is only a bit too cold!”

The freshman students all gossiped animatedly.

Ye Qingyu only just found out, that this girl who was like ice, was so famous in the academy.

On the stage.

“The first person is…” Bai Yuqing hesitated for a moment, then expressionlessly said the first name: “Qin Wushuang.”

Her voice travelled out.

In the first row, a handsome young teenager slowly walked towards the platform.

His expression did not show the slightest hint of shock, his lips carrying a faint smile. It was as if he had long predicted this happening and did not feel the slightest hint of pride at this happening.

And no one in the first year expressed any major surprise.

This was a long predicted result. Coming from a noble background, obtaining number one in the examination results, Qin Wushuang. If he did not enter the list of ten, then no one was qualified to enter the list.

“The second… Yan Xingtian.” Bai Yuqing continued to announce the second person’s name.

A youth with a rather thin figure, slowly stood up and walked towards the stage.

Ye Qingyu’s gaze landed on Yan Xingtian. This was his first time seeing this genius commoner that had been evaluated so highly by others.

Yan Xingtian looked to be only around eleven or twelve, his appearance slightly strange. His face was angular with sharp slanted eyebrows and possessing a righteous air. His ears were extremely large and could almost rest on his shoulders and his arms which were much longer when compared to an average person. When his arms dropped down, his fingers could almost reach his kneecaps.

Standing on the stage, Yan Xingtian was frowning as if he had something on his mind. He was solemn and silent.

There was nothing to argue about regarding these two choices.

Yan Xingtian was ranked second, his position was well deserved.

But the third announcement, caused people to stir slightly and was outside of people’s estimation.

“Song Qingluo!”

A young girl with long black hair hanging to her waist stood up, evidently extremely excited but suppressing her emotions. She pretended to be calm and walked on the stage, walking very quickly. She was the daughter of the president of Qingluo Merchant Company, ranking number six in the selections and could be counted as a little genius.

The classroom began to fill with the sounds of discussion.

The sixth ranked Song Qingluo was the third announced name. This was an obvious sign – when Wang Yan selected people, she did not do so according to the rankings. This caused several students who were full of confidence to display signs of unrest.

And the next name, caused people to be even more shocked.

“Song Xiaojun.” Bai Yuqing announced the fourth name.

Ye Qingyu was taken aback, an image of the cute little loli appearing in his mind.

Chapter 14:


Chapter 14 – The Second Evaluation

The next instant, it was really the little loli that stood up. Her face was filled with astonishment and confusion, looking around in all directions seeing if there was someone with the same name as her.

After spending a long time confirming that it was indeed her, she cheered and rushed towards the platform. Because she was too excited, she clumsily tripped on her long robe, landing on the ground with a thud, a swollen little red lump appearing on her forehead.

Amidst the burst of laughter in the classroom, the little loli tearfully held her robe and quickly walked to the stage.

A smile appeared on Ye Qingyu’s face.

This little loli was really too cute and clumsy. No one would have thought that this little girl’s talent would be so exceptional, that one of the four head teachers would select her.

But other people did not think in that way.

“What’s happening? How could it be her?”

“Song Xiaojun? Have you heard of her name before?”

“That’s not right, the little girl is sitting in the fourth row. She is evidently not in the top one hundred of the rankings, how can she be selected?”

“Eh, I remember now. Song Xiaojun is part of the Qingluo Merchant Company but she is only an illegitimate daughter. In the selection rankings, she is only ranked number four hundred and sixteen.”

“Four hundred and sixteen? Illegitimate daughter? This kind of person, how can she make it in the list?”

“Has a mistake been made?”

Everyone discussed heatedly, some people questioning loudly.

The conversation started becoming louder and more angry, with the spear pointing at Song Xiaojun. No one thought she deserved a position on the list.

The little loli was originally excited but seeing this situation, she was slightly scared by it. The excitement slowly became timidness, her large eyes misting up. She silently lowered her head, and did not argue back at all, her hands still tightly clenching her robe…

Ye Qingyu frowned, and was about to say something…

At this time—

“Silence.”

Bai Yuqing finally opened her mouth.

She did not raise her voice, but her words were like thunder, clearly reaching the ears of every student.

The students who had a weak constitution was stunned by this voice, seeing golden stars. Instantly, the heated sounds of discussion disappeared. Every freshman looked up in shocked silence at the girl in the white dress, their tongues frozen and with a heart filled with fear.

At this time, the freshmen finally realized that the person standing in front of them was a fourth year. A fourth year genius whose strength could easily place in the top five.

“This is the head teacher’s decision. If you are not satisfied with her decision, then go discuss it with head teacher Wang.”

Bai Yuqing’s tone was extremely cold, her gaze extremely fierce. She looked at the crowd of people below her and bitingly said these words.

Below, Ye Qingyu nodded his head slightly to himself.

One must admit, that the Bai Yuqing standing in front of him, no matter whether in terms of temperament or strength, was first class.

Within Bai Yuqing icy demeanour, there was a type of lofty grace and sacredness. This was one of the reasons why she had become the number one goddess of White Deer Academy. When compared to other female students who were like blooming flowers laughing brightly, she could more easily arouse a man’s desire.

Not knowing why, at this time, Ye Qingyu suddenly thought about Jiang Xiaohan, the girl that thought she was so clever. She was also a girl that had ambition and talent, but when compared to Bai Yuqing, there was still a large distance.

Ye Qingyu smiled, lightly shaking his head.

But somehow, not knowing why, in his heart he had a feeling that this list did not have him in it.

After this shocking scene, Bai Yuqing quickly announced another couple of names.

Those selected teenagers continued to excitedly stand on the stage.

But the previous discussions and arguments appeared again.

Because within those selected, there was another three that was like Song Xiaojun. Their examination results were ordinary, their background average causing people to not understand this decision especially those geniuses who were ranked in the top twenty but not selected. They were especially infuriated.

In the blink of an eye, the list had been announced.

Ye Qingyu’s name was not on it.

The sounds of protest could not be suppressed any longer, causing the second explosion of objection.

A tall young man from the first row stood up, his face filled with dissatisfaction and anger and said loudly, “This result is not fair, I need to know the criteria for selecting them.”

“He’s Xia Houwu, the son of the southern city leader. This time he ranked number four in the selection process, not being able to enter the list of ten is really quite strange. His strength and talent is not bad, nor is there any problem with his background, no wonder people are questioning this decision

“Hehe, this Xia Houwu is so prideful. Not being able to enter the list for him, is an unacceptable matter.”

“Good, this way we can use Xia Houwu as our mouthpiece, and question this decision. I think the criteria to select the ten people is slightly peculiar!”

Voices of dissent reached Ye Qingyu’s ears.

Ye Qingyu only just found out the identity behind the skinny and tall teenager.

Within Deer City, the two giants were the White Deer Academy and the city leader. Under them, was the Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western generals*, each responsible for commanding the soldiers in the four main areas. They have all been appointed by the royal family of Snow Country, and was part of high nobility.

The four generals only accepted the command of the city leader and their status could be said to be above everyone except him.

Seeing Xia Houwu standing up and protesting, some people immediately stood up and started shouting—

“That’s right, young master Xia is right. We are not satisfied, we want to know the selection criteria!”

“We are not satisfied, young master Xia is not picked, we are definitely not satisfied!”

The amphitheatre instantly turned into a scene of chaos.

Bai Yuqing’s face turned serious.

The freshman felt something blink across their eyes, then the cold girl moved and in a flash, appeared in front of the front row. Her entire body emitted a terrifying aura, letting out an indescribable feeling of pressure.

Her gaze was as bright as lightning in a dark sky.

This was Bai Yuqing. She was like a war god that was provoked.

She stared at Xia Houwu, her tone serious and said, “You’re not satisfied?”

Xia Houwu felt that he could not breath, a cold feeling gradually entering his body and spreading throughout his four limbs. He ground his teeth and said, “That’s right, I’m not satisfied. I ranked fourth in the selection, why can’t I enter the list of ten?”

Bai Yuqing coldly sniffed, saying, “This is head teacher Wang’s decision, do you still dare to question it?”

“The heart of the martial artist should be firm and determined and not be submissive to anyone. Even if it is head teacher Wang’s decision, if it is not fair, then of course I will question it,” Xia Houwu said, biting his teeth.

Bai Yuqing only coldly smiled.

Even if it was only a cold smile, it was beautiful enough to astonish anyone. The smile was like a flower that bloomed in winter, making the eyes of everyone brighten.

“I originally didn’t want to point this out, but if you must ask… Do you feel that someone who has relied on spirit medicine and outside help to get rank four, deserves to be in the list of ten? Do you really think that head teacher Wang is like the supervisors of those appraisals grounds, and compromise when it concerns the battle of the ten academies?”

Xia Houwu’s furious face was fixed in place.

He was like a poisonous snake that was pinched seven inches from its neck**.

Indeed, a large part of him gaining rank four was through false means.

Xia Houwu’s expression underwent many changes, half of his face green and the other red. His breathing was rapid, finally settling on an expression of embarrassed anger.

Then he suddenly thought of something.

The next instant, Xia Houwu suddenly turned around, pointing at Ye Qingyu.

“Even if I, Xia Houwu, do not meet the requirements, then what about him? Ye Qingyu is, in the entire history of the White Deer Academy, the only person to undergo five appraisals and still be able enter. With one less appraisal, he managed to get the ranking of twenty-one. Hehe, if he had gone through six appraisals, then the place of number one would surely be his. From my knowledge, he has a poor background and has not relied on any outside help. This type of person, why can’t he enter the list?”

Once he had finished, countless eyes gathered onto Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu frowned slightly.

This Xia Houwu was clearly changing the point of conflict.

In this situation and saying such words, instantly made several enemies for Ye Qingyu. At least, the gazes of Qin Wushuang and Yan Xingtian was unfriendly.

“If this commoner went through six appraisals, then he would have definitely obtained number one. Even Qin Wushuang and Yan Xingtian would be beneath his foot, hehe…This type of person, does he still not possess the requirements to enter the list?”

Xia Houwu coldly laughed.

Bai Yuqing’s gaze also fell upon Ye Qingyu.

In her cold eyes, there was not the slightest trace of surprise.

“Him?” Bai Yuqing hesitated unnoticeably for a moment.

In reality, even she found it slightly strange.

Because at the start, Bai Yuqing could clearly remember Ye Qingyu’s name was in the list. Head teacher Wang Yan praised his talent endlessly, clearly wanting to focus lots of attention in cultivating him. But without knowing the reason why, at the last moment, head teacher Wang Yan took his name off the list and selected another person.

Despite severely evaluating Ye Qingyu last night at [Residence of Heaven’s Will], but this evaluation was done with a long term perspective. She did not have an optimistic view of Ye Qingyu’s future prospects, but even she must admit, Ye Qingyu had his strong points. At least, to enter the list, the problem was not big.

However head teacher Wang Yan, at the last instant, erased Ye Qingyu’s name.

Perhaps she had some special considerations.

“Ye Qingyu is already fourteen years old, his age slightly too high. He also does not have the slightest basis in training his body and does not have any history in martial training. Even if his talent is exceptional, but in the path of cultivating, wasted time cannot be obtained back. He can be counted as half wasted already, so the academy does not have faith in him.”

Bai Yuqing gave a reason.

Even she did not know, why she would speak so much about this situation.

Then she did not even spare a glance at Ye Qingyu, returning to the podium. Retrieving her belongings, she directly left the classroom.

“If there are people still not satisfied with this decision, then you can go and find head teacher Wang. Of course, this is not the final decision. At the end of every month, there will be an elimination match within your year. If there is someone among you that can eliminate any of the ten people on the list, then you can take their place and be among the ten members.”

This was the last words the Bai Yuqing left in the classroom.

*I think I previously translated them as leaders. I’ll go back and change it now as general makes more sense to me now.

**So according to Chinese knowledge, the weak spot of a snake is seven inches below its head. And if you pinch that exact spot, the snake cannot move. Disclaimer: Would not advise for you to try this when faced with snake xD

========================================

Chapter 15:


Chapter 15 – My Temper Is Not That Good

At that time, the numerous gazes and expression people looked at Ye Qingyu with changed and became more complicated.

Clearly many people agreed with Bai Yuqing’s reasoning.

Perhaps Ye Qingyu had remarkable talent, but he began cultivating too late and wasted four years of time. Being late one year on the martial path could possibly entirely extinguish a genius.

Adding to this was the fact that the starting point of Ye Qingyu was too low. He was a commoner, without resources for cultivation. If he wanted to catch up, there was basically no hope.

It was really a waste of such natural talent.

Within the crowd, the three roommates of Ye Qingyu after discovering who Ye Qingyu was, changed their expressions entirely. They were about to discuss how to become close to Ye Qingyu, but at this time they looked at each other, changing their minds.

Since it was a person who was fated not to have a future, then there was no need to waste time and resources in becoming friends with him.

Bai Yuqing seemed to have done this intentionally.

She evidently borrowed the incident of the list to throw out such an explanation. By doing this, she destroyed the aura of Ye Qingyu after his shocking performance in the examination.

Unquestionably, this incident would quickly pass into everyone’s ears.

At that time, the entire Deer City will have another stance on Ye Qingyu.

It would be an average evaluation and a negative outlook.

The crowd gradually dispersed.

The morning’s lesson, after these words, ended.

Faced with everyone’s peculiar gaze, Ye Qingyu seemed as if he had not noticed anything unusual. He was at the back of the crowd, slowly walking towards the exit.

On his face was no trace of depression or sullenness.

It was as if nothing had happened.

Suddenly someone from behind him lightly tugged at his clothes.

Looking back, it was the clumsy little loli, Song Xiaojun. Her face filled with concern, said in a light voice, “Brother Qingyu, don’t be sad. I think what Senior Sister said was not right, otherwise, I can go and find the head teacher, to give you my place on the list…”

Ye Qingyu laughed heartily.

At that time, the Xia Houwu next to him heard his laughter. His voice filled with mockery and disdain said, “Lowly idiot, you can still laugh…”

His voice was not loud, but it was enough for everyone nearby to clearly hear.

The little loli was suddenly anxious, glaring at Xia Houwu. She said angrily, “How can you say that…”

Ye Qingyu lightly held the little loli back, shaking his head.

Seeing this action, Xia Houwu and people nearby, laughed at him with contempt. This Ye Qingyu was so fearful and cowardly, that even when he was humiliated during the lesson and after, he did not dare to strike back…

This type of person would definitely not become successful.

Xia Houwu with a cold laugh, was about to turn and leave with his friends…

At this time, Ye Qingyu cleared his throat. Facing Xia Houwu’s back he said with a smile, “Hey…”

Xia Houwu stopped, turning his back to look.

Within his vision, a fist was becoming larger and larger, quickly arriving.

It was Ye Qingyu’s fist.

From the viewpoint of Ye Qingyu, striking back with words was often a pointless endeavour. Sometimes, there were only some words that a fist can say.

This rapid transformation made everyone unable to react.

Including Xia Houwu.

But he was only stunned for a moment.

The next second, an aura expanded from Xia Houwu. He lifted his hand, and with lightning speed counterattacked, grabbing Ye Qingyu’s fist.

Suddenly the scene stopped.

At this time, many people reacted to this development.

The Ye Qingyu who everyone thought would swallow such humiliation, chose to strike back in such a way?

It was a pity, that this decision was too rash.

Xia Houwu was at the peak of the fifth stage in the Ordinary Martial stage and Ye Qingyu had not even began training. Even if his talent was greater, it was pointless, they were not in the same weight class at all.

By directly striking Xia Houwu, it only gave Xia Houwu an excuse to humiliate Ye Qingyu.

“Haha, hahaha…” Xia Houwu began to laugh. “Why have you attacked me sneakily?”

“Attacked you sneakily?” Ye Qingyu also laughed. “You’re wrong, before hitting you, I gave you a warning.”

He really did say ‘Hey’ as a warning.

“So what if you warned me? You poor little trash, you really dared to strike me?” Xia Houwu’s expression slowly became fierce.

“When you previously used me to prove your point, you should have been aware this would happen. I’m the type of person that acts without caring about the consequences. If there is a grievance, then it should be repaid on the spot and not in the future.”

“Hahaha.” Xia Houwu laughed loudly, his expression becoming ferocious. “You really are an idiot, incomparably foolish. Revenge? Pitiful, how are you going to avenge yourself? Trash!”

Saying this, he started to apply force to Ye Qingyu’s fist.

Xia Houwu would take out the humiliation that he suffered from Bai Yuqing onto Ye Qingyu…

The peak of the fifth stage of the Ordinary Martial stage, cleansing your marrow.

After entering such a stage, you at least have over five thousand pounds of strength.

This kind of strength, can instantly flatten a piece of steel, not to mention flesh and blood.

Faced with the Ye Qingyu who had not even properly started training yet, it was an absolute steam roll.

Many people thought they could hear the sounds of bones cracking, see the sight of Ye Qingyu’s fist being shattered, blood spurting everywhere…

However…

“The one who is an idiot… is you”

Ye Qingyu’s expression suddenly became sharp, taking a sudden large step. On his fist, a force like a powerful river streamed out.

Pak!

There were faint sounds of explosions in the air.

Everyone’s ears began to burst.

Xia Houwu felt as if his right palm had been hit by a battering ram, instantly going numb. His entire person was sent flying by the impact, everyone letting out screams of shock. Only by crashing into the wall of the classroom was he able to stop.

“This…”

There were only the sounds of people releasing their breaths.

Everyone’s eyes was as if they had seen a ghost.

Figures of everyone transfixed by this scene.

This scene turned around too quickly, causing nearly no one to be able to react.

“You… you… how is it… possible… that you were able to do this?” Xia Houwu leaned his back against the wall for support, humongous waves crashing in his heart, incomparably shocked. He even forgot to strike back.

Ye Qingyu stretched his arm a little, and said blandly, “I’m sorry, I used a little too much strength.”

The other people watching were like fossils.

Little too… much strength?

Heavens, this was far more than using a little too much strength!

One punch to send someone in the fifth stage flying. This… no matter how you looked at it, it was not something a person without basic training can do!

Everybody’s gaze when looking at Ye Qingyu was as if they were watching a monster.

There was a brief period of silence.

Ye Qingyu pulled along the dazed little loli, walking outside.

After walking to the door to the classroom, he suddenly thought of something. Turning back, he said to the crowd standing behind him with a gentle smile.

“That’s right, for those students who may have some thoughts about me, I need to remind them of something. I’m a person that doesn’t have much patience, and is pretty violent and straightforward. I’m also extremely petty and like to talk things out with my fist. In the future it’s best if you don’t aggravate me. If you really need to aggravate me, you need to really think it over before you do, if your strength is greater than mine is.”

Finishing his sentence, he turned and left.

Only after Ye Qingyu had disappeared in the distance, did the last of the people in the classroom manage to recover.

Xia Houwu tightly held his lips together, a spurt of blood nearly coming out.

Within Ye Qingyu’s fist, he could sense a terrifying and vast power. It was extremely abnormal, even defeating his power of the fifth stage, jarring his internal organs.

This was the reason he did not immediately strike back.

This… what is this kind of power?

Xia Houwu was filled with both hatred and shock.

And at the same time, the hearts of other students were terrified and shaken.

Especially Ye Qingyu’s roommates, looking at each other. They would never have predicted that their shabbily-dressed roommate would be so strong.

The three of them, although part of the nobility and filled with arrogance, did not even place in the top one thousand five hundred of the examination rankings. They naturally could not compete with Xia Houwu. Since Ye Qingyu can send Xia Houwu flying with just one punch, then dealing with these three was surely a simple matter.

Thinking back to the words of Ye Qingyu, that he was an extremely petty person, made them feel extremely apprehensive.

……

There was a canteen in White Deer Academy.

While the public canteen’s food could not be counted as delicious, but the good point was that it was free. Therefore Ye Qingyu’s lunch was eaten in the canteen.

Those from wealthy or noble families naturally wouldn’t appear in such a place. Only those from poor families would insist to eat in the canteen.

Only after eating four portions of food in a breath did he leave the canteen. Amidst the stunned stares of everyone, he left for the dormitory.

In the afternoon was the martial cultivation class.

Ye Qingyu decided to practice the breathing technique back in the dormitory before heading to class.

In reality, when fighting with Xia Houwu, Ye Qingyu’s arm was hurt by the recoil of the impact. The reason why he had such explosive power was all thanks to the nameless breathing technique. Perhaps it had other uses.

But no matter what, without undergoing true body refining when compared to a fighter at the fifth stage of the Ordinary Martial stage, there was still a considerable distance.

He definitely must begin training soon.

However, Ye Qingyu did not regret in the slightest over the conflict with Xia Houwu.

He knew very well what his current situation was. On the surface, everything was peaceful after entering White Deer Academy, but in reality he had already garnered the attention of countless eyes, with many things moving behind the scenes.

So that was why he must be like a hedgehog, decisively striking back against all those who provoked him. Only by doing this, could he truly protect himself. He had to make those who wanted to act against him think better of it.

Ye Qingyu was planning in his heart.

At that time, when he was passing through a small silent path, an abnormal image appeared—

Ye Qingyu suddenly realized the surrounding light was as if it had solidified. Even a falling leaf was hanging in midair.

Before he could react, he felt a blur in his vision.

An unexpected figure appeared in front of him.

The head teacher of the first years, Wang Yan.

“Are you confused as to why, within the list, there was not your name?” Wang Yan’s words contained a bland smile.

Chapter 16:


Chapter 16 – The [Serpentine stance] of the [Eight Divine Stances]

Ye Qingyu was shocked

He did not know what to say.

He was confused about not being able to enter the list. But, in reality, he really did not care about entering the list of ten. To receive more, you had to give out more. He did not want too many fetters tying him down to White Deer Academy.

Ye Qingyu had unshakeable confidence in his own talent.

This type of confidence was as if he was born with it. He firmly believed even if he did not join the list of ten, his accomplishments in the future would greatly exceed all ten.

On some level, he had never treated Qin Wushuang, Yan Xiantian as his opponents.

He has never thought about wasting four years staying in White Deer Academy practicing basic martial cultivation.

Ye Qingyu would use one year of his time to finish walking the road that others took four years.

He would only compete with time and not with people.

“In reality, from the start, the number one person who I picked to be on my list is you. The reason for this, apart from the evaluation from great teacher Hon, I have actually observed you in the selection process. I’ve heard numerous compliments and praises from different supervisors. To be honest, if I was to pick only one person instead of ten people, that person would be you, Ye Qingyu,” Wang Yan said, sighing.

A small smile appeared on Ye Qingyu’s face, respectfully nodding his head. “Thank you.”

For a certain person who was extremely vain, this way of explaining things to him was extremely effective.

“However, at the time of my announcement of the list, the Dean suddenly sent an acoustic message to me. Because of a certain reason, you are not allowed to enter the list of ten.” After every word she said, she would carefully observe Ye Qingyu’s expression.

She discovered that Ye Qingyu’s facial expression did not change at all because of her words, with no expressions of anger or excitement. It was as calm as a still pond under the sunlight. She knew, at that moment, she had still underestimated this teenager.

“For compensation, I can give you some special privileges,” Wang Yan said with a smile and when she saw Ye Qingyu starting to shake his head, she held up a hand to stop him. “Don’t reject it first, it is a nameplate that can allow you to enter the second year and third year areas. You can rely on this nameplate to enter the upperclassman’s libraries and borrow the martial manuals inside.”

Ye Qingyu hesitated.

If it was really this, then there was no need to reject.

Because these special privileges were exactly what he needed right now.

“Thank you head teacher Wang.” He respectfully bowed to her, receiving the nameplate.

A smile appeared on Wang Yan’s face and when she turned around to leave she said, “Do you know why I expect great things from you?”

Ye Qingyu quickly shook his head.

“You will know in the future.”

Wang Yan smiled at him teasingly causing Ye Qingyu to feel extremely speechless, black lines appearing on his forehead*. Without any signs, her figure suddenly disappeared like a bubble popping in the air.

The solidified light from all around became normal again.

The leaf floating in midair, finally drifted to the ground.

“As head teacher, she would tease her students? Ahem… is this power from the Xiantian stage? Her energy can freeze an area of over a hundred meters?” Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.**

After experiencing Wang Yan’s power, his desire to pursue the martial way was strengthened, but also his urgency.

Only by possessing power, could he solve the mysteries around him

Only by possessing power, could he control his own fate. Only then, could fairness and justice that has been gathering dust for many years, be shown.

…… ……

Afternoon.

Seventh sparring grounds.

“The first skin layer stage is to first make your skin so tough that when you are hit with a sword, it will be as if it was hitting leather. This part of training, is done solely by relying on external martial arts with no shortcuts, only through hard training can you achieve this…”

In the martial cultivation lesson, a tall and muscular instructor was currently passing on the techniques to cultivate in the Ordinary Martial stage.

The efficiency of White Deer Academy was extremely high.

In the morning, the head teacher Wang Yan said they would split the class into groups according to their foundations. In the afternoon martial cultivation class, they had already been split up.

Ye Qingyu, along with eighty other students, began receiving the most basic martial teachings.

Those without any foundations in the martial way were practically all the commoners hoping to change their destiny.

Of course, geniuses like Yan Xingtian who already had a deep foundation, would not appear in this type of lesson.

The burly coach began to teach.

His every word was expressed in the form of a shout, vibrating the grounds like thunder.

“In the Ordinary Martial stage, there are six small stages. Skin, muscles and bone does not have any sequencing to it, you can train it in any order you wish.”

“But after that in the blood, marrow and organs stage, then you have to be careful about the particular order. Because after, as you go deeper into the martial way, blood, marrow and organs already touches upon internal martial arts*. And these internal martial arts are what decide whether you are Ordinary Martial stage or Xiantian, if you train in a wrong fashion, it could very well threaten your life!”

“Right now I will pass on the method to train your skin, muscles and bones. Right now you don’t need to understand, only recite it. And when you’ve memorized it, then you can slowly understand it. If there is any areas that you don’t understand after three to five days, you can ask me for assistance, do you understand?” the burly teacher yelled.

“Understood!” the students responded in a similar fashion.

“Good, then listen carefully… External martial arts are only about one word, practice! How to practice, the most basic point is… Apart from this you have to practice until your shoulder and waist moves as one, your knees and arms moves as one, your hands and feet moves as one… your heart moves with your will, your will moves with your qi, your qi moves with your power…Yin and Yang flowing in a straight line, only then you can practice!”

The burly teacher shouted out the training mantras.

The students copied him, repeating the mantras after him.

Training in the martial way, the first step was to take note of the air around you. The air around you; that is qi. In the training process, you must make yourself be excited, loudly roaring so you can get your blood pumping, turning yourself into an animated state.

Ye Qingyu was within the crowd, similarly shouting.

Even though he had self-confidence in his natural talent, but he also understood the martial path was walked step by step. Even the best of natural talent needed to train hard, so at this time he could not be the slightest bit lazy but should rather put in a hundred times the effort than normal.

“What I passed to you right now, is the cultivation mantra. What I am going to pass on to you next, is [Serpentine stance] of the [Eight Divine Stances]. And this [Eight Divine Stances] is the culmination of countless experts of White Deer Academy. This is extremely suitable for training one’s body at the Ordinary Martial stage, and the [Serpentine stance] is known as the stance to train your skin, being extremely profound…”

The burly teacher, after finishing these words, loudly shouted and moved his body, demonstrating the [Serpentine stance].

“The first stance, the [Golden Snake Moves Across Land]!”

The burly teacher’s figure changed. His original muscular body suddenly seemed as if it was boneless, stepping forward. His palm was as if it was a snakes head, incomparably agile and his whole body was like a golden snake suddenly appearing on land.

There was faint sounds of ‘sss, sss’ in the air, as if there was a huge snake swallowing a bird, causing people to shiver.

Every student widened their eyes, carefully observing the burly teacher’s every move.

“The second stance, the [Teng Snake**** in the Fog]!”

Half the body of the burly teacher was already on the ground, twisting in a strange way. It was as if there really was a Teng snake slithering on the ground. It seemed slow, but in reality was extremely quick and mists seemed to appear.

This scene seemed really as if a Teng snake was slithering within the fog, mysterious and frightening.

Ye Qingyu was deep in thought.

The [Serpentine stance] was the most suitable for training one’s skin because the snake moved across the ground when it travelled. This would cause endless friction with ground, and to imitate a snake would mean to cause endless frictions using your skin. This would cause your skin to toughen and along with the [Serpentine stance], is definitely the best method to train the skin.

“The third stance, [Horned Snake Facing Its Tail]!”

The burly teacher changed his figure again, as if he really was like a snake, performing vividly.

“The fourth stance, [Mysterious Snake On A Rock]!”

“The fifth stance, [White Snake’s Tongue]!”

“The sixth stance, [Wind Snake On A Tree]!”

“The seventh stance, [A Viper’s Poison]!”

“The eight stance, [Divine Snake Moon]!”*****

The burly teacher constantly changed his forms.

Without knowing how long had passed, in Ye Qingyu’s eyes he could no longer see the burly teacher. Before him, it was as if there really was an ancient snake moving, sometimes hissing, sometimes striking explosively, sometimes still as a rock, sometimes spitting out poison…

A vicious aura of a snake came at him, making Ye Qingyu feel as if he was in a crowd of ancient snakes.

“Good, today I will pass on these eight forms to you. Don’t underestimate them, the forms are definitely not simple. Great things are made from simple things. Little kids, if you can successfully understand the essence of these eight stances within half a month, then you will definitely see the door to the first skin stage!”

The burly teacher finished demonstrating, loudly shouting.

His eyes swept across the students. He discovered that the majority of students were thinking furiously about something, with a few impatient fellows already beginning to imitate him.

He smiled and nodded his head.

They were geniuses selected from tens of thousands of people, and had managed to imitate to a level that was quite similar.

“Eh?”

His glance landed on Ye Qingyu, suddenly taken aback and letting out a gasp of shock.

He could see Ye Qingyu’s body as if it was really a snake, utilizing the [Serpentine stance].

Under the sunlight, Ye Qingyu stretched. The first stance [Golden Snake Moves Across Land] had already been exhibited by him, with every action and detail being done superbly. Clearly, he had already understood the insights of the first stance.

“This is a bit interesting, to have understood so quickly…”

The burly teacher nodded his head silently. Ye Qingyu was an important seedling, he naturally had noticed him before.

The first stance of the [Serpentine stance] seemed simple but major insights were not easy to obtain. Contained within were the pure, profound understandings of countless experts who formed this stance from countless trainings. And the version of the [Serpentine stance] in White Deer Academy was different from the shortened versions outside. It was more profound, and to complete every stance you had seen was extremely taxing.

I love this description, its so Chinese so I decided to keep it in xD **there we have it boys. I don’t know whether to laugh or cry, this is officially a proper xianxia now 😛 *** So quick 101 on Chinese martial arts. External martial arts are simply stances and techniques that you can accomplish using your muscles. Internal martial arts are moves that you can only do so with qi.

**** Legendary Chinese creature.
