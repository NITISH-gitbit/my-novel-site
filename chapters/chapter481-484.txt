Chapter 481:


Under the gaze of countless disbelieving eyes, the scene of the blade and fist striking each other seemed to happen in slow motion.
Ye Qingyu's fist, advanced further inch by inch. It was like he had struck a log of rotten wood. The golden blade that was at the pinnacle of a Treasure tool was turned into smithereens bit by bit. There were formations flickering on the edge of the blade, and disappeared like a snapped chain. It dimmed and was destroyed, disappearing in the air.
The toughness of the fist was incomparable.
Just how powerful was a blade at the Treasure tool state that was being fully activated by an expert at the peak of the Bitter Sea stage?
Enough to make an army fall, enough to make the landscape change, enough to make the sun and moon lose it's luster...
But it could not make this fist that was made from blood and flesh retreat...
Not to mention able to hack apart this fist.
It even had no way of leaving a white scar on the fist
It could not even slice apart one small hair on the fist.
The golden glimmer broke apart, scattered, destroyed, and disappeared in a way that no one expected.
The Golden Moon Blade, destroyed.
The person wielding the blade, defeated.
HIs palm was crushed into pieces, his arm breaking apart. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, as he flew back spitting out fresh blood.
The power contained with that bare fist was really too fearful. It not only shattered the golden blade, but there was still remnants left from the strike. Through the hilt of the blade, it vibrated into the right arm of the younger Greater One Sect disciple, and was sent flying.
Furthermore, it was not finished.
The Greater One Sect disciples behind him extended their arms instinctively, wanting to catch their comrade who had been sent flying.
But when their arms had just briefly touched the back of their young comrade, they could only sense a force that was vast like an avalanche or tsunami, surging from the body of their comrade. It was absolutely not something they could support with their arms alone.
Before they could even react, there was cracking sounds. The person's arms snapped, turning a shocking angle. Then he could only feel a force in his chest, a sweetness at the back of his throat. His vision turned black, his entire person being sent backwards.
The Greater One Sect disciple in the air was still somewhat conscious. The shock in his heart was absolutely like a storm.
His strength was not the strongest out of all his senior brothers. But he was at the Ocean stage of the Bitter Sea stage. Although his body could not be said to be absolutely strong, but his arms could at least withstands hundreds of thousands of pounds of force. Even if a mountain fell down, he had the confidence to receive it, but he had no way of receiving this senior disciple.
One could see from this, just how terrifying was the force that Ye Qingyu shattered the [Golden Moon Blade] with, for the remnants of the strike to be so terrifying?
"That young bumpkin is too terrifying... even if the masters of the sects comes, they won't be his opponent... I must remind the other disciples to not try things on too hard..." He had such thoughts in his heart, but completely had no way of saying such words.
At this time, his other disciples had already acted.
There was a huge hammer at the peak of the Treasure tool stage that was emitting fierce flames, like it was a little mountain. There was golden formation chain after chain dancing around it, emitting a pressure that was enough to shake the heavens. Under the activation of a Greater One Sect disciple, it had the power of thunder and lightning as it struck towards Ye Qingyu.
Ye Qingyu did not even pay a glance at this times incoming attack, still striking out with one fist.
Boom!
That huge hammer whose aura seemed to break apart the heavens, once it met the fist, was like it was a sand sculpture. With a crash, it turned into smithereens.
The formation array on it's body, as well as those formation chains, were instantly annihilated.
The Greater One Sect disciple that was controlling the hammer Treasure tool had an expression of astonishment and disbelief. His face was instantly pale yellow like thin gold. Blood spurted from his mouth as he fell backwards.
This huge hammer was the Treasure tool that was tied to him. After it was destroyed, he immediately suffered from the effect of this.
"Kill!"
Amidst the shouts, there were four or five rays of light that neared to kill.
There were some Greater One Sect disciples that activated their Treasure tools. Like they were meteors or shooting stars, they neared Ye Qingyu to strike to kill him.
"Careful!"
The old commander Li Guangbi could not help but let out a shout.
Who could have guessed that Ye Qingyu did not even pay attention to these rays of light. His fist struck out directly, towards a Greater One Sect disciple in front of him.
There was a pure black shield held in the hands of this disciple. This was a rarely seen defensive Treasure tool. Under it's activation, the formation light was like a dragon or phoenix dancing. There was layer after layer of black-coloured fluctuations appearing, the thickness of these protective layers like a mountain, vast like a hill.
Kacha.
A noise sounded.
The black shield let out an endless black splendour.
But it ultimately was not able to withstand the power of that fist. Amidst its moans, it instantly shattered into pieces, transforming into thousands of black fragments. It was like withered butterflies falling throughout the air.
The Greater One Sect disciple that held the shield spurted out blood, howling as he was sent flying backwards.
As for the other rays of light, they also struck on Ye Qingyu's body like rapid thunder.
This was six flying blades that was as thin as a cicada's wing. Under the light, there was a strange blue colour that appeared. Evidently, it was filled with lethal poison. There were miniature golden formation lights flickering on the body of every blade. Evidently, it was an extremely vicious and lethal assassination tool.
"Hahahaha, die!"
The Greater One Sect disciple who was controlling these cicada-like flying blades was delighted. He madly activated his set of Treasure tools.
But it was as if Ye Qingyu did not even notice. His hand casually moved, then two Greater One Sect disciples who were attempting to launch a sneak attack were crushed along with the Treasure tool in their hands. They were sent flying out, spurting blood.
The cicada blades landed squarely on his body.
When there was mad delight on all the faces of the Greater One Sect disciples, at this time, there was once again a chain of six noises that sounded in the air.
Such a noise was like golden needles striking upon divine steel.
One could see a series of sparks appearing on Ye Qingyu's bodies.
Those golden cicada wing-like flying blades were instantly sent rebounding backwards. They could only cut Ye Qingyu's clothes, but was not even able to leave a white trace behind on his body.
"Puh..."
The Greater One Sect that controlled the cicada wings flying blades spat out blood. His figure quivered, his face pale.
How could this be possible?
At this moment, the rebounding force that emitted from the cicada blades that was tied to him had even affected his spirit and blood qi. It caused him to sustain significant internal injuries.
Heavens.
The power of this person's fleshly body, how could it be...
How was it possible for someone's body to be tough to this extent?
The cicada flying blades he had were a rarely seen assassination treasure. Under the flying blades, it had drank the blood of many experts. It had killed even countless demonic beasts. he had never experienced a situation like he did today.
Could there be some treasured armour on the body of this person?
Or perhaps he was not human. Was he a divine beast wearing human skin?
He finally realized how bad the situation was.
No matter what the situation, it was not something his cicada blades could deal with.
After that Greater One Sect disciple spat out a mouthful of blood essence, he madly activated the cicada blades, wanting to retrieve it.
But it was already too late.
Because Ye Qingyu swiped his hands, like he was swatting at some flies. Those six cicada flying blades were held in his hands, and his hands lightly clenched together. A string of powder streamed out from his palms. Those flying blades that had undergone countless refinement, that could cut apart steel like mud, were crushed like a lump of soil into pieces by a light squeeze of his hand…
"Impossible!"
That Greater One Sect disciple let out a loud scream of disbelief.
Ye Qingyu, as of this moment, was like he was made of metal. From top to bottom, he did not have the slightest hint of weakness. Although he did not activate the power of yuan qi, but every move he made was filled with an absolute power. It was completely something the Greater One Sect disciples could not block. Even Treasure tool that had been refined thousands of times was like porcelain, instantly crushed.
The other side.
Qu Hanshan as well as Li Guangbi and the others, had an excited light exploding in their eyes.
The situation had really completely reversed.
They had not imagined that the Lord of the Light Palace Ye Qingyu would be so forceful and domineering.
Just what sort of divine technique was this?
The worried heart of Lin Zheng, finally began to settle.
He had originally concentrated and gathered qi, making the preparations to act in an instant. Once Ye Qingyu encountered danger, he would instantly give his help.
But from the current situation, there was absolutely no need to act. The Ye Qingyu in front of him was just how many times more powerful than during the battle of the [Light Palace]. If Ye Qingyu had the cultivation he did now, then Lin Zheng estimated he would absolutely not be Ye Qingyu's opponent.
"Ye Qingyu's yuan qi martial foundation was really destroyed. So how is it possible that he has such a powerful cultivation? Could it be that because of the divine thunder, he was able to refine his body? Or perhaps her highness has given him some legendary divine martial manual?"
Lin Zheng's heart hiddenly shivered.
But his attention was quickly diverted to another area.
Seeing that the result of Ye Qingyu defeating this crowd of Greater One Sect disciple seemed to have been already decided, Lin Zheng began to consider what to do after.
After all, these Greater One Sect disciples was the first batch of guests that had come from a Central Domain Gate. Although they were arrogant and domineering, but they were still humans. They could not really completely kill them off.
Temporarily imprison them?
Or perhaps torture and interrogate them, and get a more complete picture of what the other domains were like?
The matter was gravely important. Even Lin Zheng who was used to reading the situation and making a judgement could not decide at this moment.
This matter, it seems like he must consult her highness Yu Junhan.
But since the matters today had escalated to like so, he had already reported to Yu Junhan already. But why was it that she had not arrived even now?
Lin Zheng was originally a person who thought extremely deeply and carefully. At this time, he also could not be sure.
At this time, Ye Qingyu's fist struck out. The last standing Greater One Sect disciple was sent flying. Only then did he stop.
There were tens of Greater One Sect disciples. The weakest of them was at the peak of the Bitter Sea stage in terms of cultivation, while the strongest of them were experts half a step into the Heaven Ascension stage. Although they were restricted by the laws of the the Heaven Wasteland Domain, and had no way of fully using the power of the Heaven Ascension stage. But they had all sorts of rarely seen Treasure tools on their bodies, and were all top level experts within top level experts.
Such a crowd of people was enough to run rampant throughout any area within Heaven Wasteland Domain. It was enough to contend against any sort Imperial station in this world.
But such a crowd of people, through a few casual steps and movements of Ye Qingyu, was like rotten logs being hacked through. They completely fell, without the opportunity or power to resist at all.
Such a battle record was really far too terrifying. If news of this was to spread out, it was enough to make the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain quake. Ye Qingyu, would be given the title, of the [Number One Expert of Heaven Wasteland Domain].
Under the gaze of countless disbelieving eyes, the scene of the blade and fist striking each other seemed to happen in slow motion.
Ye Qingyu's fist, advanced further inch by inch. It was like he had struck a log of rotten wood. The golden blade that was at the pinnacle of a Treasure tool was turned into smithereens bit by bit.

========================================

Chapter 482:


Chapter 502, Mistakenly entered

The disciples of the Greater One Sect were scattered across the ground, whining and groaning, covered with injuries, their face distorted from pain, and were unable to get back up.

Ye Qingyu was standing in the middle of this group of people.

Besides the slashes across his white clothes because of the cicada wing throwing knife, he was completely unwounded.

His black hair was like waterfall, his white clothes flawless, his figure was tall and slender, standing motionless and straight as a javelin. Under the golden sunlight coming through the huge window, Ye Qingyu was as though draped in a layer of shining gold armour, exhibiting an indescribable imposing manner and charm.

“A group of bad guests dares to bark.”

Ye Qingyu slowly walked out from a heap of gourd-like Greater One Sect disciples, looking at Lin Zheng, Li Guangbi and the others as he said, “These guys have evil intentions, I see that they may not really represent the Clear River Domain and the Greater One Sect. There’s no need to discuss the business of the domains with them, it would be better to arrest them, and deal with them later.”

Lin Zheng and other people exchanged glances, and also nodded.

Under such circumstances, it was the only way.

In this world where the strong is the leader, any signs of weakness or apology and one would not really get respect.

Sometimes, you must be tough.

An order was issued down.

Very soon there were Imperial guard experts coming in, restraining the several Greater One Sect disciples in formation refined gold shackles, planting a seal using the Imperial guards secret technique, temporarily sealing their yuan qi, and causing their strength to plummet, and then took them all away.

Within the Imperial guards camp, there was a secret gold prison created by several gold-refining formation masters of the Imperial household.

The Greater One Sect disciples were all imprisoned separately.

This was considered a temporary end to the matter.

How to deal with these Greater One Sect disciples was something that Lin Zheng and the others needed to worry about. Ye Qingyu did not say anything else, but he could roughly guess that, given Lin Zheng’s nature and that these Greater One Sect disciples had become prisoners, they certainly would not be given any good treatment and most likely could not escape from a strict interrogation with torture.

Since the skin has been torn, Lin Zheng no longer had any scruples about anything.

The most important thing at present was to find out the situation of Clear River Domain’s Greater One Sect and other domains from these disciples of Greater One Sect.

Of course, all the things that happened in the main tent today, including the arrival o the Greater One Sect disciples, were extremely confidential. They were not allowed to disclose the slightest information, Before Ye Qingyu turned away, he reminded them again that they must not expose the fact that he had helped out today.

……

As soon as he returned to his residence, Ye Qingyu closed the door and began training.

Ever since the Battle of Light City, the impression that Ye Qingyu had left on the others was that his foundation had been destroyed and his body was weak. Ye Qingyu, under the temporarily conditions of being unable to use his yuan qi, began to refine a new fighting method, especially since his physical strength had rocketed. How to fight against experts was a problem that he had been thinking about all this time.

Today, the fight against the Greater One Sect disciples was on one hand to stand up for the Imperial guards, to suppress the arrogance of these foreign domain people, and on the other hand was to train up his own body, to try new ways of fighting.

He was satisfied with the results.

The Greater One Sect disciples were almost all struck down to the ground by his fist and foot, the most primitive way of fighting. During the process where every punches bites, the wild and lawless feeling made Ye Qingyu feel his blood was racing. He felt like he had a new intuitive understanding of the current strength of his body.

Ye Qingyu was very confident that, based on physical strength alone, there was most likely no one in the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain that could match up to him.

Even though he smashed peak treasure weapons with purely his body, Ye Qingyu did not feel the slightest pressure. When that cicada wing knife slashed across his body, it was just like being struck by a wooden stick. In other words, Ye Qingyu’s current physical strength was far more frightening than those peak treasure weapons.

Ye Qingyu himself was now a humanoid Dao weapon.

This was under the premise that he had not activated the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] and had not transformed into a dragon.

If he transformed into a dragon, what sort of level would the strength of his body reach?

Ye Qingyu himself also did not know.

Of course, this did not mean that when his physical strength reaches this sort of level, he would become invincible.

After all, the mainstream martial arts of this world was the cultivation of formation yuan qi, no matter how strong his body gets, there was no way he could activate formations, treasured weapons or Dao weapons, and could not reach the flying speed of real yuan qi experts.

Just like today, the Greater One Sect disciples were also perplexed.

If they had not chosen to fight and instead turned away and fled, there would have been nothing that Ye Qingyu could do.

Even though he could leap up thousands of meters and climb the mountains, there was no way he could catch up to his opponents.

“There has to be a way to make up for my weakness in this area.”

Ye Qingyu pondered

In addition, from today’s battle, Ye Qingyu once again felt the importance of weapons.

Those Greater One Sect disciples were not only young and powerful, but each one of them possessed a treasure weapon. This was their capital. If he encountered an opponent of the same level, on the basis of this treasure weapon, they instantly would have the advantage.

This made Ye Qingyu a little alarmed.

These Greater One Sect disciples, although extremely strong, were hot tempered and did not have the mental state and shrewdness that matched with their own strength. Adding to this, their experiences in battle were evidently lacking. If the Clear River Domain really was a mature domain, if the Greater One Sect really was a powerful-leader-like sect of the Clear River Domain, then there was one thing that he could be absolutely sure of——

The disciples that appeared in Heaven Wasteland Domain were by no means the core elite disciples of the Greater One Sect.

This conclusion was even more nerve-racking.

Such a group of people was not the core disciples, then how much more terrifying would the real core disciples of Greater One Sect be?

Those non-core disciples were all wielding a peak treasure weapon, then what kind of weapons would the core disciples of Greater One Sect have? Dao weapons? Saint weapons?

If there really were Greater One Sect experts and they carried sacred weapons, how could he contend against them with his physical strength alone?

Ye Qingyu asked himself.

He had no confidence.

Even if he wanted to rapidly improve the strength and cultivation of martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain, it was obviously not realistic, but if the top experts of Snow Empire had some top weapons, it should reduce a lot of pressure.

Ye Qingyu sat crossed legged and began to continue cultivating.

His mind, sank into the [Cloud Top  Cauldron], joining with the part of his mind in it and continuing to observe the writings and mural on the walls of the [Cloud Top Cauldron], constantly improving the strength of his mind.

……

In the next few days, within a radius of 300 miles of Light City, the outside was relaxed and the inside was tensed.

Ye Qingyu had been practicing in seclusion.

And Lin Zheng was indeed as Ye Qingyu expected, subjected the Greater One Dect disciples to questioning via torture.

For a ruthless person such as Lin Zheng, interrogating these highly ambitious but lowly Greater One Dect disciples was simply too simple. These Greater One Dect disciples, although strong, but their experience were really much worse than a white paper, like a group of green shoots growing out of a greenhouse. How could they stand up to a fierce and formidable person like Lin Zheng?

In less than a few days, Lin Zheng had gathered and understood the structure and inside information of the Clear River Domain from the Greater One Sect disciples.

When Ye Qingyu came out, he also received a related Imperial bulletin.

Lin Zheng told Gao Han to send it over.

Ye Qingyu read the Imperial bulletin, gaining a general understanding of things over these past few days.

“So, these Greater One Sect disciples did not intentionally come to Heaven Wasteland Domain through the [Domain’s Heavenly Walls], but because they mistakenly entered the space-time cracks during a training session and accidentally came to Heaven Wasteland Domain through the [Domain’s Heavenly Walls]?” Ye Qingyu slowly folded up the bulletin.

Gao Han nodded. “That’s correct, when the Right Minster interrogated the Greater One Sect disciples, other people of the [Light Palace] were also invited over to listen. I also participated. Right Minister’s methods were indeed amazing. This information was gathered from different Greater One Sect disciples. It had been carefully checked many times, there should be no mistake.”

“In other words, the Greater One Sect is really one of the very best Human Race sects of Clear River Domain?” Ye Qingyu nodded. “Clear River Domain is a mature domain, and the Greater One Sect is one of the best sects of the Human Race, but among the entire Clear River Domain, it is not any impressive power. In the Clear River Domain the Demon Race runs rampant and the Demon Race are seen as the main pillars. This training session was Clear River Domain’s Heavenly Gate test. During the training process, they were chased by the Demon Spider Race and fled into Heaven Wasteland Domain?”

“According to their statements, it seems so.” Gao Han carefully reported back the whole procedure of the interrogation.

Ever since the battle in the Imperial guards camp, Gao Han worshipped Ye Qingyu this young leader at the deepest level.

Now, he basically believed that no matter what situation they ran into, there was nothing that Palace Lord Ye could not solve.

All that was impossible, all the things that should not have happened, seemed to have become the norm with Palace Lord Ye.

After Gao Han reported back the collected information, he added, “From these Greater One Sect disciples’ statements, although Greater One Sect is a large sect of the Human Race, its conduct and actions are in any way no different to those of the Demon Race. They are ruthless, reeking of blood, cold hearted and have no sense of human racial responsibility. The civilians of Clear River Domain also do not receive protection or assistance from the Greater One Sect.”

Ye Qingyu nodded. “This can be seen clearly from the words and actions of the Greater One Sect disciples.”

After a pause, Ye Qingyu added, “Since they mistakenly stepped into Heaven Wasteland Domain, then this Greater One Sect is nothing to worry about. Their masters also would not come over so soon... We have plenty of time to prepare.”

As he was saying this, suddenly there was a sergeant dashing over.

“Palace Lord, Right Minister asks to see you, he has important matters to discuss.” A light soldier knelt down on one knee.

Ye Qingyu was slightly startled.

What was happening now?

Chapter 483:


Chapter 503, The demon spider curse

“What? A Greater One Sect disciple wants to see me?”

Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.

“Yes, a Greater One Sect disciple called Lin Yi wishes to see you. He says he has important information to report to Palace Lord Ye. Other people have asked him, but he refused to say what it is,” Lin Zheng said with a smile. “It seems you have proved yourself to these arrogant and proud boys through that battle, now it seems they only recognize you.”

“Only recognize me?” Ye Qingyu laughed. “It most likely won’t be for any good reason.”

Lin Zheng also laughed, “These disciples are, although arrogant and have shallow experience, not stupid people. They have just experienced too little. After being locked up for a few days, someone thinks they are smart and most likely have the intention of stirring trouble between us. To use this trick on me is nothing but wishful thinking.”

Ye Qingyu asked, “Lin Yi is that young and tall Greater One Sect disciple?”

“Yes, that’s him. These Greater One Sect disciples are all pretty young, around twenty or thirty years old. They possess such cultivation base at such a young age, it is evident that the standard of martial arts in Clear River Domain is much higher than Heaven Wasteland Domain. That Lin Yi is 41 years old and is a senior brother of Greater One Sect. He is not the strongest, but he thinks thoroughly. He was the one who asked to see you.”

“Then let’s see him, see what he has to say.” Ye Qingyu also looked forward to meeting this Greater One Sect disciple.

……

Half an hour later.

Ye Qingyu’s face gradually grew serious.

“You mean, while training in the Clear River Domain’s Heavenly Gate test, you guys killed a prince of the Demon Spider Race, who was also the most outstanding genius of the Demon Spider Race in the past hundred years and a successor candidate that the Demon Spider Race focused on cultivating for years? As a result, you were desperately chased, and mistakenly entered into the space-time cracks and came to Heaven Wasteland Domain? And those experts of the Demon Spider Race planted a curse on your body, so sooner or later they would come to Heaven Wasteland Domain?”

Ye Qingyu asked.

The Greater One Sect disciple called Lin Yi repeatedly nodded.

“Yes, that is right, the Demon Spider Race is descended from the ancient Demon Race. It is ferocious and cruel, and feeds on humans. The young Prince is also well-known to be brutal and had once swallowed hundreds of people. Our Greater One Sect had long wanted to get rid of it. We finally found the opportunity during the Heavenly gGte training test...”

Ye Qingyu raised his hand, motioning Lin Yi to stop for now.

Then, after a pause, he asked, “Forgive me for being so blunt, if the blood-Prince, really was a genius of the Demon Spider Race seen in a hundred years, you people would be no match for him. It wouldn’t be so easy for you to kill him. Do you want to tell me that you used some sort of secret technique or secret treasure.”

Lin Yi’s face assumed an awkward expression as he tried to explain, “Of course not... But the Prince of the Demon Spider Race was too arrogant. During the Heavenly Gate training he unexpectedly challenged a fully grown blood vine to capture the natural endowment bone formation of the blood vine. In the end both sides suffered, and even though he had the remarkable skills of the Demon Spider Race and eventually killed the blood vine, unfortunately he had also sustained heavy injury. And just then we passed by, so..."

Ye Qingyu nodded, “Oh, I understand, taking advantage of another’s perilous state.”

Lin Yi looked more awkward than before, stammering, “This... this is considered taking advantage of another person’s perilous state, but those who are not our race are sure to be of a different heart. The Demon Spider Race is a huge worry of the Clear River Domain, pressuring all major sects to the point of almost being unable to breath. The Prince is also known to be brutal and ruthless, especially towards the Human Race. If he was in charge of the Demon Spider Race in the future, then our Human Race would be in danger of being destroyed, so... so after much consideration, we decided that we would rather bear the infamy of taking advantage of another person’s perilous state, and kill that guy.”

Ye Qingyu nodded, and decided not to comment this time.

Noticing that Ye Qingyu’s expression had not changed, Lin Yi breathed a sigh of relief.

He added, “Even so, more than 50 brothers who participated in the training also paid a disastrous price. 22 people were killed on the spot. The rest who were wounded, while fleeing from danger, were killed one by one in order to cover us. We were chased by the members of the Demon Spider Race that received the news, and with no other option we charged into the space-time crack to take a chance. There were only just over 10 of us left when we escaped to your domain.”

“And what are you trying to tell me?” Ye Qingyu asked.

Lin Yi gritted his teeth and pushed up his sleeve, revealing a scarlet spider mark on his huge arm. At first glance it looked as though a blood spider was lying on his arm, vivid and realistic, sucking his blood and essence.

“This is the curse mark of the Demon Spider Race. Yesterday, it was still very blurry, today it had already changed shape.” There was a look of fear flashing within Lin Yi’s eyes. “This shows that the experts of the Demon Spider Race had found the coordinates of your domain, they would soon arrive. If they intrude your domain, it would surely be a disaster. Your Human Race empire is nothing but a lush and sweet pasture to them. In their eyes, you are only food. Once their experts descend none of you can withstand their wrath!”

Ye Qingyu’s eyes were fixed on the bright blood-coloured spider mark, in no hurry to make his position clear.

The blood red spider mark was containing a mysterious and strange secret.

Its aura was indeed completely different to the aura of Lin Yi’s cultivation skills. There was an extremely evil and bloody fluctuation of force on careful examination. It was undoubtedly a demonic object, and not a facade that Lin Yi constructed with his own cultivation techniques.

Ye Qingyu thought it over, then slightly flicked his fingers.

A gust of sword intent shot past.

Swoosh.

The spider mark was wiped away and destroyed, and the colour of flesh was spreading across his arm at once.

Lin Yi groaned, soybean-sized sweat forming on his forehead and rolling down. He was evidently in pain, but did not scream in pain or struggle at all.

That blood and qi expanded into a six-foot blood red spider image in the air, producing a shrill screech, bared its sharp fangs and pounced at Ye Qingyu at lightning speed.

“Be careful, that is the power of the curse of the Demon Spider Race. Once it comes into contact with the body, you can’t remove it...” Lin Yi reminded loudly.

Ye Qingyu stretched out his five fingers and held the blood red spider image within the grasp of his hand’s vice-like grip, while activating [Supreme Ice Flame], and in the midst of a barely audible scream of a demon king-like voice, he easily refined it.

A look of astonishment crossed Lin Yi’s face at once, “You... can dispel the force of the demon spider curse, you... ah, yes, that day you could dispel junior brother fan’s [Decaying Qi]. You must possess some sort of secret treasure... can you...”

Ye Qingyu interrupted him with no trace of politeness, “You want me to help you remove the demon spider curse? You really are asking too much, let alone that my strength is not enough and cannot refine such a strong curse, even if I could why should I help you?”

Lin Yi’s face darkened.

With a wry smile, he replied, “Little brother, I can understand why you are hostile to us, after what we have done. On behalf of my other brothers I apologize to you, but we are all part of the Human Race, can we not put this behind us?”

Ye Qingyu’s face was icy cold as he said, “Stop, don’t try to establish connections for the sake of personal gain, how would I know whether or not what you just said is true?”

Lin Yi anxiously cried out, “You have to believe me, every word that I say is true, that old man called Lin Zheng has been questioning us every day, you can go ask him.”

“Since Minister Lin Zheng interrogated you, why did you not tell him instead, but came to tell me these things?” Ye Qingyu asked, his eyes narrowing.

Lin Yi’s face suddenly radiated off an air of arrogance.

He stood his body up straight as he began to explain, “I admit that minister Lin Zheng’s strategy is very powerful, pierces right at people’s heart, and nothing could be hidden from his eyes and mind, but so what? In this world, where the strongest is the leader, no matter how powerful his calculating strategy is, he at best would only take on a counsellor role in military strategy. He cannot really become a martial arts leader. He is too inferior to show in public, and in this domain, from the people that we have seen, only little brother you have cultivated your techniques to the peak. Even in Clear River Domain, you would rarely find a worthy match. Our Greater One Sect is an ancient sect, and our disciples all have pride and dignity, even if we surrender it would only be to real martial arts experts and not to some sort of advisor.”

Ye Qingyu’s face was void of expression when he heard this.

But in his heart, Demon King Ye was secretly laughing.

Disciples of Greater One Sect have dignity and pride?

Nonsense, where did they practice such amazing boot-licking skills?

Lin Yi hurriedly continued, “Little brother, there is not much time, in less than two days, the experts of the Demon Spider Race would really descend. If you do not prepare in time, it would certainly be a crushing defeat for you, a bloodbath, and your domain would become scorched soil. My brothers also can’t escape death...”

“Oh, you’re afraid to die, so you told us that much, right?” Ye Qingyu shot a glance at him.

Lin Yi repeatedly nodded, like a chicken pecking grains. “That is right, if the Demon Spider Race descends into this domain, everything is over. You and I are in the same boat, so I had to speak out the whole truth.”

Ye Qingyu’s expression turned grave, fear in his eyes, as he began to believe him a little.

“All of you have been cursed by the Demon Spider Race’s curse?” Ye Qingyu asked.

Lin Yi nodded.

Ye Qingyu waved his hand, motioning Gao Han to come over, whispered something to his ears, and Gao Han went off.

“How can you prove these words are true?” Although Ye Qingyu already more or less believed him, he decided to squeeze out all the information that this Greater One Sect disciple knew.

Lin Yi stared blankly at him then answered, “I... everything I said is the truth, you can go ask another brother, our words will match.”

Ye Qingyu laughed grimly and did not say anything.

Lin Yi had an anxious look, his eyes flashing with all sorts of colour, and his complexion was repeatedly changing, until he finally clenched his teeth, as though he had made some sort of decision and said, “Little brother, I have something in my hands that can prove what I just said. I can also give this thing to you, but you must believe me...”

Chapter 484:


Chapter 505, Blood Drinker Sword

As Lin Yi spoke, he was mobilizing the last trace of yuan qi within his body to take out a piece of bright red object from the storage space, and slowly handed it over.

Ye Qingyu eyes were instantly focused on this object.

“This is...”

The object in Lin Yi’s hand was a long and wide rectangular parallelepiped of about 3 inches tall, radiating clear and bright energy, a force unique to a divine-level origin crystal.

Of course what attracted Ye Qingyu’s attention was not this divine-level origin crystal.

But the object that was sealed in this piece of divine-level origin crystal through a very remarkable method.

It was a palm-sized bone as colourful as blood, which looked like it was solidified from the brightest blood in the world, and on which there were numerous lines of runes that were like strands of hair-like chains, constantly flashing and moving about, seemingly extremely mysterious.

After a glimpse of the divine-level origin crystal, Ye Qingyu could suddenly feel that there was an ocean of blood roaring towards him, completely drowning him.

There was a mournful shrill voice ringing in his ears like the roar of a demon god, shaking his soul.

At that very moment, Ye Qingyu’s mind and soul wavered and shook.

Impatient, he suddenly bit the tip of his tongue and frantically activated [Supreme Ice Flame]. The pain from the tip of his tongue and the cool feeling from the ice flame had helped him get rid of this blood illusion.

Despite this, Ye Qingyu’s breathing was rapid and his face went pale.

“Little brother, are you... you okay?”

Lin Yi’s expression abruptly changed as he asked anxiously.

He also did not think that Ye Qingyu would have such a big reaction when he saw this piece of treasure. In Lin Yi’s view, Ye Qingyu’s strength was so frightening that he should be able to easily withstand the force of this object. He didn’t expect that...

Lin Yi of course did not know that Ye Qingyu’s mind was currently incomplete. The majority of his mind had been sealed and imprisoned in the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. His physical strength was unparalleled, but the strength of his spirit was far inferior.

It was only when Ye Qingyu drew a deep breath that his face gradually resumed his usual complexion, and he nodded.

“What is this thing?” Ye Qingyu asked.

Vaguely, he could already sense the extraordinariness of this object.

Lin Yi hurriedly explained, “This thing is a natural endowment bone formation of the blood vine that the young Prince of the Demon Spider Race obtained when he killed a fully grown blood vine. At that time that spider entered the dangerous area of the Heavenly Gate training and challenged an immemorial blood vine. Although seriously injured, he had successfully killed the blood vine and obtained a natural endowment bone formation of a blood vine, but unfortunately he was found by us. After killing the spider and gettting this object, I kept it safe for the time being.”

Ye Qingyu began to understand.

Lin Yi took out this object to support his claims before.

From his tone of voice, this blood vine was a great thing, and its natural endowment bone formation was also an extraordinary treasure. Otherwise it would not have attracted the young prince of the Demon Spider Race to hunt for it at the risk of his life.

And this precious treasure could not be imitated and forged.

“In the Clear River Domain, a blood vine is a well-known demonic object. It lives on blood and likes drinking blood the most. Even experts of the immortal realm are afraid of facing a fully grown blood vine head-on. Once a Heaven Ascension expert was captured by the blood vine, they would instantly be sucked dry, their essence, energy, and blood and qi would all be taken away. It was rumoured that long ago the whole Clear River Domain was a world of blood vines, then later martial arts experts came into being and destroyed the blood vines, opening up a space where other living creatures could live together. But even so, the blood vines could not be completely wiped out and were eventually sealed in the Heavenly Gate of Clear River Domain...”

“All right, all right, don’t talk so much nonsense.” Ye Qingyu gestured with his hand. “Get to the point.”

Lin Yi stuttered, “Yes yes yes, although blood vines are terrifying demonic objects, its natural endowment bone formation is an extremely rare treasure. If one could plant it in their body, one could gain the blood drinking skill of blood vines, and by capturing opponent’s blood, one can gain the opponent’s remarkable powers and even control their opponents. If it can be refined into a weapon, it can exhibit qualities of Dao weapons and even sacred weapons. It also can continue to mature and grow...”

Ye Qingyu was beginning to understand.

There had also been rumours in Heaven Wasteland Domain about natural endowment bones. There have also been Human Race experts that had killed those of the Demon Race to acquire natural endowment bones.

Yan Buhui was one of them. He had planted a natural endowment bone of an old ancestor of the Snow Ground Demon Court in his body to obtain the Demon clan’s remarkable ability. He could summon time and space demon spirits, and his strength had greatly increased.

“This blood vine’s natural endowment bone, I am willing to offer it to little brother in order to prove our sincerity.” Lin Yi immediately acted while the conditions were favourable, handing over the Divine-level origin crystal in his hands.

Ye Qingyu slowly got up. “Right Minister Lin Zheng will make a decision regarding the affairs of the Snow Empire. Your thing, you can give it to Minister Lin Zheng, even the joining of forces to fight against the coming of the experts of the Demon Spider Race, Minister Lin Zheng will take full charge of.”

Lin Yi stared at him blankly.

He couldn’t quite believe what he just heard.

Faced with a natural endowment bone of a fully grown blood vine, there was unexpectedly someone who would refuse?

This treasured object, even in Clear River Domain, would be a precious thing that can cause chaos and trigger the top forces to fight over it... But now?

Does this young man not know the value of a natural endowment bone of a fully grown blood vine?

Impossible.

He had already explained it clearly.

Lin Yi was at a loss for words.

At this time, Ye Qingyu got up and left.

Lin Yi wanted to speak again, but there was no chance anymore.
