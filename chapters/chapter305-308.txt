Chapter 305:


Ximen Yeshui and Little Nine continued on arguing and bickering, not noticing the change with Ye Qingyu.
As they continued.
They continued to encounter many remnants of the battlefield.
It seemed every thousand meters or so, they would discover the bodies of powerful experts.
It was as if this was a road of death paved with fresh blood.
But the corpses they encountered after did not all die by the spear. Evidently, it was not the mysterious owner of the red-tasselled spear who had acted. Since this matter concerned the legacy of the pFormation Sovereign] Luoso, everyone would risk their lives to obtain a chance. In the world of martial artists, pulling one’s blades out after some conflict was an extremely normal matter.
It was only that there were too many people who had died.
And they were all powerful experts.
Ye Qingyu could not help but feel regret.
So many experts. If they could be used to truly protect the Human Race and defend at the borders, resisting against the invasions and attack of the demon races, it would be the best. If these people appeared on the battlefield, then there would be much less death in the Empire. The situation of the Empire would also not be so desperate and hard-pressed…
It was a pity, but the humans after the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could not truly unite together.
Since time was tight, Ye Qingyu could not even stop and observe the reasons behind the death of these people.
He could only increase his speed.
The further he went, the hotter the bronze medal got within his chest.
Ye Qingyu was increasingly sure that within the mysterious space of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign], there was something or perhaps some power that had activated something within the badge. They resonated with each other.
Four hours later.
Ye Qingyu brought Ximen Yeshui into the tenth zone.
The instant they entered into the tenth fog zone, Ye Qingyu could not help but grit his teeth.
The [Power of Annihilation] had already grown to such an extent that it nearly exceeded the limits of Ye Qingyu’s strength. The [Power of Annihilation] was not as terrifying as the Power of Chaos, but it contained, lightning, light, and the power of the five elements scattered throughout in disorder. It caused a deep headache.
Ye Qingyu bit his teeth, not activating the [Limitless Divine Way] to resist.
According to the markings on Ximen Yeshui’s maps, they must pass through all these zones, before they could truly enter into the heart of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign].
If he showed all his cards at this moment, Ye Qingyu felt he definitely had no way of enduring until he exited from the fog zones.
Although the [Power of Annihilation] was frightening, but it could aid a martial artist in training their fleshly body. All sorts of energies and powers were immersed together in disorder. It was even more effective in training the power of a martial artist than simple pressure alone.
Ye Qingyu’s martial cultivation path first began when he had assimilated with a mysterious drop of blood within the Dragon’s Den in the [Boundary Canyon Battlefield]. Then he was refined for a length of time in the [Cloud Top Couldron] of the [Pill King of Azure Phoenix]. Furthermore, he was able to obtain the [Supreme Ice Flame] in the [Den of the Snow Dragons] to help refine his body. It could be said that his body refinement had met many fortuitous encounters.
Solely by the toughness of his body, he could already be called the strongest amongst his peers.
But ever since the battle of the martial alliance in Proud Sky Center, under such huge pressure, when he activated the [Third Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way], Ye Qingyu evidently felt that the toughness of his body was by far not enough.
In the state of the [Third Limit], when his yuan qi exploded, his meridians and channels were nearly at a state where it could not endure any more and would explode. Afterwards, he felt that his channels were sore and swollen. When he returned from battle and recovered within the military camps, Ye Qingyu discovered that there were already countless hidden injuries and fractures within his acupuncture points and meridians.
These hidden injuries were like rivers choking up with silt and sludge. Although it would not have too much damage in the immediate future, but after the accumulation of time, there was a possibility it would destroy his meridians.
Thankfully, it was discovered in time.
After a period of time of intentional rest and recovery, Ye Qingyu could be said to have returned to normal.
Of course, Ye Qingyu had already realized that a huge problem had appeared in his martial path.
As his yuan qi cultivation madly rose, the toughness of his body could barely keep up with such progress.
Therefore, he had always remained largely within the [First Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way]. The reason that it was hard to increase beyond the [First Limit] was because the toughness of his body had no way of withstanding such a humongous energy.
But refining his body, was not like increasing his yuan qi cultivation. One could not rely on medicinal pills or Origin crystals to increase it. Therefore, Ye Qingyu did not have a better method in the recent period of time.
In reality, Ye Qingyu had met with multiple fortunes – the strength of his body already far exceeded anyone at the same cultivation level. If it was anyone else, for anyone’s yuan qi cultivation to explosively increase from one Spirit spring to sixty within just one year they would long have exploded because their body had no way of withstanding such power.
But even after multiple fortunes, there was still an issue.
Because Ye Qingyu’s yuan qi cultivation had grown too rapidly.
His body refinement became the limiting factor.
Therefore, sensing the vast pressure of the [Power of Annihilation], Ye Qingyu also sensed that his opportunity had arrived.
He bit his teeth, activating the nameless breathing technique, and coordinated with the pressure, beginning to refine his own body.
This process happened soundlessly.
The nameless breathing technique had long been integrated within Ye Qingyu’s very bones. He had no need to meditate, and could activate it naturally. It did not disturb the speed of their journey, and Little Nine and Ximen Yeshui did not sense anything.
After an hour, they had travelled past the tenth zone.
Ye Qingyu could no longer be sure just where the distorted fog zone had brought them. But he could be absolutely certain, that they were no longer in Deer Mountain.
“Eh? You’re sweating…” Ximen Yeshui looked with surprise at Ye Qingyu’s forehead. There were beads of sweat dripping down his head. He could not help but ask, “Do you need my help?”
What he meant was that he would naturally aid Ye Qingyu the next time they entered into the next zone to resist against the [Fog of Annihilation].
Ye Qingyu shook his head.
“Haha, don’t force yourself.” Ximen Yeshui smiled. “I am a very straightforward person. Your strength is not quite enough. It’ll be very hard for you to finish traversing through all the zones. Although without you, I most likely will get lost in these foggy zones, but I cannot force you to lead the way. Little brother, think over it carefully. If you retreat now, it’s not too late.”
“No, let’s continue.” Ye Qingyu smiled.
After an hour of using the nameless breathing technique and taking advantage of the [Power of Annihilation] to refine his body, the effect was better than what he had estimated. The moment they left the fog, Ye Qingyu felt a strange warm stream that ran beneath his skin. This was one of the signs of success in refining his body.
“Fine, if you can’t stand it anymore, then give me a shout. I’ll help you,” Ximen Yeshui said, looking loyal and filled with the spirit of brotherhood. Slapping his large chest he said, “Perhaps the future road will be difficult to travel. But rest assured, I will protect you. You won’t need to fear with me here.”
“I did not say I was afraid.”
Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry at this comrade who treated him so familiarly.
Little Nine was a person who remembered who had wronged him even after ten thousand years. At this time, he was still biting onto Ximen Yeshui’s finger, not even willing to loosen at the slightest. Ximen Yeshui tried every method, but could not get the glutton off.
In the blink of an eye, four hours had passed again.
The three had already reached the fourteenth zone.
Ye Qingyu’s body was covered in sweat, his clothes nearly completely drenched.
And the warmth that ran beneath his skin, at this time, had transformed into a fire that swept the plains. It spread throughout his body, through his organs, flesh and bones. It was like an endless fire running about, as if his entire body was being bathed in scorching lava.
Ye Qingyu let out a breath, and it was like fire was being spat out. He entered into a strange state.
And what made people feel strange, was that under such a state, he could no longer sense the power of the [Fog of Annihilation]. Even though the terrifying power of the fog had multiplied, he could no longer even feel any sense of pressure.
“Are you training right now? What cultivation technique is it? It’s strange, I feel that if you continue on like so, you will be in danger. Your innards will be cooked… do you really not need my help?”
Ximen Yeshui continued to nag.
Evidently, he was exceedingly curious about what was happening in Ye Qingyu’s body.
Ye Qingyu did not pay the slightest of attention to his nagging.
The endless [Fog of Annihilation] surged all over him. He had finally reached his utter limits.
The yuan qi surrounding Ye Qingyu completely disappeared.
The next instant, the [Fog of Annihilation] had completely pierced through the yuan qi surrounding Ye Qingyu.
Che!
Without the support and protection of yuan qi, the clothing on Ye Qingyu’s body completely turned to ashes.
“Hey, little brother, you are streaking!”
Ximen Yeshui began shouting.
He had an expression of someone delighting in someone else’s plight. It was as if he had long awaited this moment.
“Wahahaha…” Little Nine also couldn’t help but chuckle loudly.
As he laughed, Little Nine’s mouth finally loosened. This was the moment Ximen Yeshui was waiting for. At the first instant, he retrieved his finger.
Little Nine was taken aback, then reacted. He once again pounded like a bolt of lightning at him, wanting to bite on yet again. Ximen Yeshui hid both of his hands away, not giving him the slightest of chance.
“Woof!”
Little Nine was enraged, and directly bit onto one of Ximen Yeshui’s leg.
“Ah… you really are a dog!” Ximen Yeshui began screaming tragically.
Ye Qingyu did not have the energy to deal with these two living treasures.
HIs clothing completely disappeared, and he instantly became naked.
Thankfully, Ye Qingyu had prepared for such a scenario. Using the [Supreme Ice Flame], he used the vapour of the ice flame to envelop him so that he would not be naked in the fog.
As for the items in his interdimensional pouch, it also could not withstand the destructive power of the [Fog of Annihilation]. Ye Qingyu had long prepared for this, and placed it within the [Cloud Top Couldron] within the clear springs of his dantian world.
Ximen Yeshui and Little Nine continued on arguing and bickering, not noticing the change with Ye Qingyu.
As they continued.
They continued to encounter many remnants of the battlefield.
It seemed every thousand meters or so, they would discover the bodies of powerful experts.

========================================

Chapter 306:


Ye Qingyu felt that his entire person was about to burn up.

His entire person was like he was drunk. He began to feel dizzy and woozy.

the nameless breathing technique naturally activated.

Large beads of sweat began seeping out from the pores of his skin.

What also came out was some murky and sticky substance. Ye Qingyu already had no energy to see just what kind of substance it was because he felt that within this burning sensation, there was a strange energy that was currently being born.

This kind of power was especially evident in his dantian world.

It was as if something was currently being born in his dantian world.

"This power is somewhat familiar... I seem to have seen it somewhere." Ye Qingyu had a strange sensation that such a power had once appeared within his own body, but he could not recall it at this moment in time.

Time began to flow on, bit by bit.

They finally arrived at the eighteenth zone.

This was the last zone

After they finished traversing this fog zone, they should have truly reached the legendary palace of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]. At that time, they would be able to tell whether the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign], Luoso, was contained within.

On the way, they had met with too many experts that had died in battle.

Within such a group were existences that had truly stepped into the Bitter Sea stage. However, they had also failed in their struggles and turned into corpses on the ground, unable to return forever.

Ye Qingyu was currently in a stange woozy state. Without stopping in the slightest, he directly headed towards the eighteen zone.

"Little brother, you really have guts. To not wear clothes and enter, you must be the first. I am impressed." Ximen Yeshui gave him the thumbs up and followed closely behind.

The instant they entered into the eighteenth zone, an unprecedented pressure from the [Fog of Annihilation] came over them. It surged towards them from every direction.

Even Ximen Yeshui had a serious expression at this time. A faint layer of water circled around his body. The power of water attribute aura emanated from him, blocking the destructive power of the [Fog of Annihilation].

At this time, he dared not pretend. He paid attention to Ye Qingyu's situation, preparing to give aid at any moment if he needed it.

What made him confused was that with Ye Qingyu's evident strength, he could tell that he was only at the sixty Spirit springs of cultivation. With Ye Qingyu's age, he could be counted as prodigious, but he should have no way of withstanding the destructive power of the fog of the eighteenth zone.

But Ye Qingyu still continued to walk on. The yuan qi around his body was completely destroyed, but could his flesh body withstand such pressure head-on?

"He really is a monster, no wonder..."

Ximen Yeshui seemed to have thought of something.

As for Ye Qingyu, right now, he was completely isolated from the world.

The destructive power of the eighteenth zone caused one to shiver.

As the pressure increased, when the fiery heat in his body reached its pinnacle, it was as if there was an ancient and vast roar of a dragon resounding from his consciousness.

That right, a dragon's roar.

Then an unexpected change occurred.

Faintly, there was a light that appeared in front of them that tore apart the endless mists.

An expression of complete shock and dumbfoundedness appeared on Ye Qingyu's face

Because in the endless light, he could see a tall and almighty Sky Dragon. It had appeared within his vision, it's gaze piercing through the air. It floated in the air, along with the sun and moon, staring at Ye Qingyu.

The might of this Sky Dragon was like a god amongst dragons. Ye Qingyu felt like he was a speck of dust in front of it. There were bolts of lightning encircling around it, rain and wind following it, light dimming everywhere. It had a massive body in the air, but an unexplainable speed. It coiled around the stars, the stars not even a size of it's scale. Resplendent specks of light surrounded his body...

It was as if everything around him completely disappeared.

there was only Ye Qingyu and the Sky Dragon in this entire world left.

It was as if time and space had already lost all meaning.

Just what was happening?

Ye Qingyu was extremely shocked.

Before he could make any sort of reaction, that incomparably large head shot towards him from above. The head of the dragon was like an asteroid that struck towards him. Before Ye Qingyu could react in the least, it had struck Ye Qingyu's body.

There was not any pain.

Nor was there any impact.

The instant it made contact with Ye Qingyu's body, the inexplicably large draconic head seemed to have assimilated within Ye Qingyu's body. Like a gust of wind, this terrifying impact and pressure completely disappeared.

It was not only the dragon's head.

At that same time, the body that was so vast and towering that the stars were only specks, the body of the Sky Dragon, had all rushed within Ye Qingyu's body. In the time of a spark, the huge Sky Dragon had completely disappeared. It was as if it had turned into part of Ye Qingyu's body, once again returning within Ye Qingyu's body.

The endless light disappeared in front of him.

The strange burning sensation of his body also completely disappeared.

Ye Qingyu's consciousness began to recover.

The terrifying pressure of the [Fog of Annihilation] still struck towards him.

Ye Qingyu struggled to open his eyes.

Everything had returned to normal.

The scene that had just appeared seemed to be an illusion.

Ximen Yeshui had a complete face of shock, as if he had seen a ghost. His eyes were wide, and he stood there frozen beside Ye Qingyu.

"What are you looking at me like that for..."

Ye Qingyu opened his mouth to speak.

But inexplicably, what came out of his mouth was not the language of the Human Race.

A dragon's roar, like the anger of a thunderstorm, sounded beside his head.

Ye Qingyu was taken aback.

He subconsciously looked about everywhere. But they were still within the fog zone. However, the moment he caught a glimpse of his hand, he stood there frozen.

Becase his hand... was no longer a human's hand.

It was a dragon's claw.

A claw that was covered with faint silver dragon's scales, flickering with the light of the stars. A dragon claw that was sharp like heaven's blade.

Along with the dragon's claw, it was the dragon's limb.

Dragon's body.

"What is this..." As Ye Qingyu spoke, a clear dragon's roar resounded throughout the environment. At this time, Ye Qingyu could be sure that the dragon's roar had originated from his mouth.”

He turned around to have a look.

The hundred-meter-long dragon's body had silver scales ficerking. It was filled with an explosive sense of beauty. A pressure that only the Dragon Race had, began seeping out from within the dragon's body. The [Fog of Annihilation] nearly did not dare come near it in the slightest. The dragon's body slowly floated throughout the air, and there were faint signs of lighting that followed along it, tracing the beautiful curve of it's body.

"I..."

Ye Qingyu had nearly lost his ability of speech.

He could not believe everything he saw.

He began to understand Ximen Yeshui's gaze, like someone who had seen a ghost.

Because he had already understood what had occurred.

He had turned into a dragon.

He had turned into a silver Sky Dragon.

And the silly dog Little Nine that had always bitten onto Ximen Yeshui's leg, also had an expression that wondered if he was dreaming. He had long unconsciously loosened his mouth, his mouth gaping wide open as he stared at Ye Qingyu.

"Woof... master, you... you've completely... transformed. Or have you shown your original form?" He asked dumbly.

"I must be dreaming..." Ximen Yeshui gave himself a hard smack on the face.

Ye Qingyu's gaze swept around his body.

With a thought, he controlled his ice yuan qi to appear in front of him, and formed an ice mirror. The image on the mirror evidently showed his appeared. He was namely a silver Sky Dragon that was a hundred meters long. It was the same as what he saw in the illusion, only that he was much smaller. He was like an infantile dragon, but he already had the form of a divine dragon.

It was him.

It was Ye Qingyu.

He had transformed into a dragon.

Transformed into a silver Sky Dragon.

A flicker of light flitted in Ye Qingyu's minds. He suddenly understood.

This was the martial path of Draconification.

In the past, when at the Snow Dragon's Den within the Explosive Snow Glacier, that slumbering mysterious figure that had awakened from the sleep of billions of years had once mentioned that he had passed on the true martial will of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] to Ye Qingyu. He had planted a martial seed of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] within Ye Qingyu's dantian.

At that time, Ye Qingyu had only comprehended about ten percent of this seed.

Therefore, when his ice yuan qi leaked outside his body, although it had the shape and form of silver dragons, it was only the form. It did not possess the true might of a Sky Dragon.

Afterwards, Ye Qingyu returned to Youyan Pass, and because of the conflict between the Jianghu and the army, he could not calm his heart to comprehend the [True Will of the Sky Dragon]. He could not take a step in the direction of this true martial will.

Therefore, Ye Qingyu's understanding towards the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was not complete.

He had always imagined that the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was a powerful yuan qi offensive technique. Therefore, he began making efforts in such a direction, but he was ultimately not able to make much progress. It was only at this moment when Ye Qingyu understood that the true might of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was not to train his qi, but to refine his body.

The [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was a martial secret that had to do with body refining.

Therefore, within the [Fog of Annihilation], when his body was under attack by the disordered destructive power, under such humongous pressure, Ye Qingyu was able to accidentally used the nameless breathing technique to activate the seed that the mysterious figure had left behind. He had manage to awaken such power, and the power of will burned throughout his body. Finally, under such a condition, Ye Qingyu had finally managed to utterly comprehend the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].

Any true martial will, once it was fully comprehended, one would obtain a divine ability.

The draconic form of Ye Qingyu was evidently the ultimate ability of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].

Ever since the Dragon Race was born, they had the most powerful battle power. In the God and Devil Age, the Dragon Race, Divine Race and Devil Race where the invincible races of the Vast Thousand Worlds. They were natural born warriors.

Under such a state, Ye Qingyu's body had risen to an abnormally powerful state.

Ye Qingyu controlled his body facing the ice mirror.

The white-coloured Sky Dragon in the mirror moved according to what he willed.

When his dragon claws closed and opened, Ye Qingyu felt that his strength was invincible. It far exceeded the power of his human form. If heaven and earth had a hoop, then he could completely grab the hoop and drag Heaven and Earth together using his physical power.

Chapter 307:


Chapter 308 - A Move for a Move

Ye Qingyu could feel the powerful physical strength of the dragon form.

Vaguely, he began to understand that the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was not what he had initially assumed it was. This profound technique meant to increase the offensive power of yuan qi was, in fact, a powerful method of body refining. The reason he could not comprehend it before was that he was going down the wrong path at the very beginning.

It wasn’t till now, that he finally understood the true meaning of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].

Luckily, this [Fog of Annihilation] made him accidentally use the power of annihilation to refine his body. Only through this was he able to stimulate the seed of true martial arts will that the mysterious illusory figure left in his own body. He had finally completely activated the power of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].

“Chen Moyun once said that I have a body type that is the [Holy Body of the Dragon’s Blood], This must be one of the main reasons that I could comprehend the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] so quickly.”

In Ye Qingyu’s mind, countless thoughts flashed by.

He drew a deep breath, slowly attempting to withdraw the scorching hot energy in his body and trying to control the profound power of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon]. After all, he could not always maintain this sky dragon form.

As the energy slowly receded from his four limbs and body like the tide retreating, Ye Qingyu felt the wonderful changes within his body.

The sky dragon in the ice mirror had its figure gradually enveloped by a faint silver ice flame, and then its tremendous body shrank. Its silver scales began to peel off, entering back into his body and exposing human skin. Finally, the dragon head, tail and body vanished as he returned back to human form.

Ye Qingyu returned to the form of his human body.

The silver-coloured ice flame was still enveloping the pivotal parts of his body, and he was still in a naked state.

“You’ve changed back?” Ximen Yeshui’s eyes shone with a curious light. “Hey, which is your true form, you are not part of the legendary Dragon-Human Clan, right?”

Silly dog Little Nine circled around Ye Qingyu a few times, looking just as excited. “Master, I think that your huge worm appearance is much more impressive. Why change back to your human appearance…”

Ye Qingyu did not bother to answer these two buffoons.

In that instant of transforming back into human form, Ye Qingyu immediately felt the earth-shattering murderous power of the [Fog of Annihilation] return like a tsunami. It made his muscles ache and bones crack. He was in terrifying burning pain like he was shrouded in blazing flames. Ye Qingyu instantly realized that he could not withstand the murderous force of the eighteenth fog zone of the [Fog of Annihilation] when he was in human form.

Once again, he activated the profound meaning of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].

Layers of dense and thin mercury-like scales grew out from his skin.

From the ice mirror, Ye Qingyu could see that his entire body was covered with silver ice flames. hen a huge dragon body, head and four claws stretched out from the ice flames. Accompanied by a low draconic growl, he once again transformed into the form of a hundred-meter-long silver sky dragon.

The silver scales emanated a bright light.

The surrounding [Fog of Annihilation] could not near him at all.

The terrifying force of oppression vanished without a trace.

Ye Qingyu controlled his dragon-form body, constantly adapting and getting used to it.

A moment later, he had completely adapted to the shape of the dragon’s body.

“Let’s go.”

He opened his mouth to speak, but a clear and resounding dragon growl sounded out instead.

The language of dragons was only understood by the Dragon Race.

Ximen Yeshui exchanged a glance with silly dog Little Nine, trying to figure out Ye Qingyu’s meaning.

It wasn’t until Ye Qingyu turned and swam into the depths of the fog that they finally responded. Little Nine thought for a brief moment, then pounced over and bit onto Ximen Yeshui’s heel. Ximen Yeshui tried to fling him off, but in the end he ignored this vindictive dog and followed behind the silver dragon, continuing into the depths of the fog zone.

The markings of the map kept flashing in Ye Qingyu’s mind. He constantly matched up the markings in the black jade scroll to the area right now.

Although he had transformed into the form of a silver sky dragon but the martial arts techniques that he had mastered in his human form could still be used fully. When he looked inside, he could still see the barren world of his dantian, which was no different from when he was in his human form. The various spiritual weapons stored in the warm Spirit spring could be freely taken out as he wished.

Along the way, Ye Qingyu made several attempts to adapt to the new shape of the silver sky dragon body.

In addition to trying to control the body, he was mostly concerned about which body he should use to fight.

Very soon, he found that in the dragon form, the strongest weapon to fight with was his very own body.

The strength of this body was simply at the level of his dreams. Although Ye Qingyu had not really attempted this yet, but he had complete confidence in using this body to fight head-on with a low level expert of the Bitter Sea stage. When he activates the yuan qi in his body, the silver scales all around the sky dragon would emit a silver glow and a chill of terror would fill the surrounding air, controlled by his mind. If he opened his mouth, he could breathe out [Supreme Ice Flame] from his mouth.

The only drawback was that the dragon claws were not suitable for most human weapons.

And Ye Qingyu was now basically certain that the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was only a kind of remarkable ability of martial arts. After transformation, he had not really become a dragon, so he could not awaken the memory passed on in the legendary Dragon Race and all sorts of magical powers unique to the Dragon Race.

But for Ye Qingyu, it was already far more than enough.

As he entered deep into the eighteenth fog zone, the roaring of the demonic beast horde became much clearer. All sorts of demonic beasts were frantically roaring and howling, like they were fighting. Within the fog, there was a faint smell of blood, and all kinds of mournful howling, like the rage of the ocean, made people feel restless.

Ye Qingyu let out a low growl.

A clear dragon’s roar resounded.

The horde of demonic beasts below were evidently intimidated by the roar of the dragon. The howling and screaming immediately stopped.

But after a moment, the frantic roaring of the demonic horde echoed again.

Back as it was before.

Very quickly, an hour of time had passed.

The [Fog of Annihilation] ahead began to fade.

They had reached the edge of the fog zone.

“We have almost arrived to the outside boundaries of the eighteenth fog zone, we must be careful. We are nearly at the district of the temporary Imperial Residence. I believe that many masters have already arrived. Human actions are hard to guess at. There may be an ambush up ahead.” Ximen Yeshui’s face grew more serious, stopping Ye Qingyu and said after some thought, “Little brother, there will soon be killing. Do not hold back, a single slip may cause everlasting sorrow... How about this, follow behind me. If a fight does happen and your big brother can’t cope, you run away as fast as possible.”

Ye Qingyu changed back to human form.

They were already at the edge of the eighteenth fog zone and the pressure had weakened a lot. The human form could also withstand it.

Retrieving fresh clothing from the interdimensional pouch, Ye Qingyu instantly activated his yuan qi throughout his body. He prepared to enter the state of the [First Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way] at a moment’s notice. Nodding his head, he was not too courteous as he followed behind Ximen Yeshui as they left the area of the fog.

The fog was getting lighter.

Vaguely, the situation outside could be seen.

What made Ye Qingyu look slightly disappointed was that there were still ancient city ruins as before.Collapsed walls, broken deity statues, bricks and tiles were everywhere. It seemed that there was no difference from the situation outside of the fog zone. Is this the so-called moving Imperial Residence? It shouldn’t be. Or was the information wrong? There was no such thing as the so-called legacy of the [Formation Sovereign] Luoso?

While his mind was off somewhere else——

Whoosh！

A harsh sword light, like a bolt of lightning, suddenly appeared, attacking head-on.

“Who is it?” Ximen Yeshui was very alert, reacting at the first instant, and shouted as he punched out.

Bang!

In the air, there were sounds of water erupting, rumbling like a tidal explosion.

The sword light crumbled.

“Good, strength is not bad. You are an able person, you qualify!” the person with the sword said in a low voice, drawing back his sword and did not attack further.

Ximen Yeshui humphed coldly, a tremendous energy surging all over him like an endless ocean tidal wave, rolls of thunder rumbling in the surroundings. The silly but amusing scholar that had a poor sense of direction seemed to have switched to another person at this moment, exhibiting an indescribably imposing majesty. Walking with his head up like a dragon filled with dignity, he stepped out of the dense fog in huge strides.

Ye Qingyu followed.

The [Fog of Annihilation] dispersed.

Opposite.

A middle-aged swordsman with long grey hair was clutching a sword in his hand. Sliding his sword back into its sleeve, his face turned stern and his eyes were sharp like a sword.

And at his side stood dozens of people with different faces, all dressed differently. They did not seem to be in the same gang. For some reason, standing here, they all had a similarity: each of them had strong yuan qi surging through their body. The weakest of them was around the level of the Bitter Sea stage. It was evident that every one of them were masters amongst masters.

Among the crowd Ye Qingyu noticed a familiar face.

The young master of [Matchless Blade City] Qin Zhishui.

This young top-level swordsman had once appeared in Youyan Pass and showed himself in the martial arts meeting in Proud Sky Center, but he kept low-key and quiet—— In fact, all the disciples of [Matchless Blade City], at that time in Youyan Pass, were very well-behaved and abided by the rules and did not follow the bad example set by others like the Crepe Myrtle Sect and the Dragon Tiger Sect. Throughout the martial meeting, Qin Zhishui did not say a word, and after the meeting ended, he immediately left Youyan Pass.

Ye Qingyu did not think that he would meet Qin Zhishui here.

And it looked like he came alone from [Matchless Blade City] because he stood at the side by himself, keeping a distance from the others. The eye-catching fiery red robe that the disciples of [Matchless Blade City] wore and the even more fiery red cloth on the sword shaft made Qin Zhishui looked like a silent flame. A kind of chill emanating from him.

“It was you that attacked us just now?”

Ximen Yeshui glared at the grey haired middle-aged swordsman that was standing opposite him.

“So what?” Perhaps because he felt the blaming tone in Ximen Yeshui’s voice, the middle-aged swordsman smiled coldly and his tone became more forceful.

Ximen Yeshui’s lips curved into a smile. “A move in return for a move.”

Before his voice died away.

He threw out a punch.

Six blue water ripple marks appeared, spiralling along his arm.

The strange blue water ripple marks, like a blue sea snake, coiled around his fist, forming a bright blue watermark fist. In response to the thunderous rumble of surging sea waves within Ximen Yeshui’s body, he struck the middle-aged swordsman.

Chapter 308:


Chapter 309 - Shrine Gate Opens

“You arrogant bastard!” A killing intent flashed across the grey-haired middle-aged swordsman’s eyes.

This man was of a high level swordsmanship. With a slight flick of his wrist, a resplendent sword light shot out, several times more oppressive than the sword light from before.

The arc of light of sword qi slashed across the air, and wherever it went, the air split like the waters of the sea were parted. It tore through space.

But all this, in front of Ximen Yeshui’s fist, was like nothing but an illusion. His punch smashed everything in front of it to pieces but his fist did not weaken and the power did not fade. It instantly arrived before the middle-aged swordsman’s body.

“Huh?”

Startled, the middle-aged swordsman drew his sword up in front of his chest, one finger pressing against the blade of the sword, and directly caught the blue fist.

Bang!

Powerful qi exploded.

The clear spiritual sword suddenly made a loud clanging noise that rang through the air as it broke into five or six pieces. The middle-aged swordsman tried to stabilize his body, but was propelled back by the tremendous force, ploughing up the earth and broken stones with his feet. However, he still could not stop his body, stumbled back dozens of meters and tore two shockingly deep grooves in the ground

The people around were all gasping in shock.

The majority of the people were aware of the background and cultivation level of this middle-aged swordsman. He was definitely regarded as one of the strongest people among the Heaven Wasteland Domain. The crowd knew that none of them could have sent him flying with one punch like the scholar did.

Just what was the scholar’s background and why was he so strong?

There were all sorts of thoughts running through the minds of these people. The eyes they looked at Ximen Yeshui with were all filled with fear.

Even Ye Qingyu, who was following behind Ximen Yeshui, was thought to be Ximen Yeshui’s servant. The people present could basically determine Ye Qingyu’s qi and cultivation level with one glance, so they did not place too much attention on him.

Only Qin Zhishiu who was standing at the side by himself, had a light flickering in his eyes beneath his sword-like brows, as he nodded to Ye Qingyu.

But he didn’t say anything.

Ye Qingyu did not expect that the silent and cold swordsman would greet him. After slightly being taken aback, he furtively nodded back.

“I thought it was some master, but it was an appetizer.” Having succeeded in one move, it was unavoidable that Ximen Yeshui looked a little smug. Looking at the furious face of the middle-aged swordsman, he smiled, “Your strength is so weak, but you want to test the strength of latecomers. This really is an old man eating arsenic, wanting to commit suicide. You’re lucky that you’re still alive.”

His mouth was so vicious.

The middle-aged swordsman was trembling with rage. Bloodstain was on the corner of his mouth, and his eyes gleamed with sinister resentment.

But he did not attack again and bitterly retreated to the side.

Ye Qingyu secretly remembered the face of the middle-aged swordsman. To be able to resist making a move in such a situation, this person’s mind was deep - he must not be underestimated. He obviously retained a strong resentment against Ximen Yeshui, and also him. If he found the opportunity, he would definitely retaliate.

“Why are you standing here? Are you waiting to rob us?”

Ximen Yeshui’s gaze swept across the crowd.

Someone snorted coldly and did not look at him.

Someone pretended that they did not hear his words.

But there were those that evidently wanted to make friends with this young scholar. An elderly clad in armour with crazy hair like withered grass, looking extremely fierce like a lion, walked out with a smile. “We are waiting for the gate of the Imperial Residence to open. Little friend, do you not know about the secret?”

“The gate of the Moving Imperial Residence?” Ye Qingyu asked.

The armoured old man cast a glance at Ye Qingyu and ignored him, turning around to face Ximen Yeshui. “This may be the real Moving Imperial Residence. Just a while ago, when the residence appeared and the gate was opened, some people managed to enter. Just that every time it opens, only 12 people are allowed in, so everyone is waiting here for the gate to open again...”

Before he finished talking, he caught sight of silly dog Little Nine hanging at the heels of Ximen Yeshui, and he became speechless.

This scene was too comedic. Can you imagine a scholar, who was regarded as a powerful master, being bitten at his heel by a fat pig-like dog? The armoured old man thought he must be seeing things.

Ximen Yeshui was not self conscious in the slightest. Nodding his head he said, “I see... Oh, I understand. The strong people have already entered the Moving Imperial Residence. You guys must be too weak and could not win against those people, so you had to wait here, right?”

The armoured old man’s face flushed with embarrassment.

Ye Qingyu could feel sweat dripping in his heart. Ximen Yeshui’s mouth was like a poisonous snake - he was lucky that he was still alive and hadn’t been beaten to death yet. It must be that there were only a few people in your so-called sect or he would long have been killed.

“Brat, do you want to die?”

“You’re so young, but use your words so carelessly. You are bound to die early.”

Among the crowd, people started shouting their discontent.

They were indeed defeated in previous battles, so they had no choice but to wait here. Ximen Yeshui’s words were tantamount to uncovering their scars, but also mercilessly sprinkling salt on it. If it was not for the fact that they had already seen his strength, and he was indeed strong, he most likely would have been killed already.

While they were talking, noises echoed from the [Fog of Annihilation] behind them once again.

Someone was coming?

“Humph, there are still people coming. There are so many people that are not afraid of dying,” from the crowd, someone said coldly, and the air was thick with killing intent.

When the gate of the Moving Imperial Residence opens, only 12 people could enter. There were already nearly 20 people waiting in front. With another person, the probability of entering the gate would be lower, which is something that none of them wanted to see. Anyone that got out of the fog area would only be killed instantly, or asked to leave if their strength was not up to standards.

Faint footsteps sounded.

A figure slowly appeared.

The instant that Ye Qingyu looked behind, his heart jumped up.

The figure that walked out from the [Fog of Annihilation] was a slim girl, dressed in a dark red warrior robe and a mask with gold engraving on her small white face. Others may not see anything, but Ye Qingyu recognized her at one glance.

If it was not Song Xiaojun, who else would it be?

Ye Qingyu never thought that he would meet Song Xiaojun again.

Because he was blocked by Ximen Yeshui, Song Xiaojun did not see Ye Qingyu at the first instant.

She quietly walked out of the [Fog of Annihilation], keeping her head low, her dark red hair hanging down like drifting clouds. She exuded an aura warning strangers not to come close. As though deep in thought, from beginning to end she had not raised her head to take a look at anyone. As she stepped out of the fog, her footsteps came to a stop and she did not say a single word, waiting quietly.

All eyes fell on Song Xiaojun.

“A little girl?” Someone in the crowd snorted.

But no one was tempted to test her power.

Because the power of the dark flames emanating from Song Xiaojun’s body was frightening, making one’s heart beat faster. It all showed that this seemingly quiet and cold maiden possessed powerful strength.

Ye Qingyu could not hold back asking, “How did you come here?”

Song Xiaojun raised her head. The moment she caught sight of Ye Qingyu, a bright light flashing in her eyes that was like ten-thousand-year-old ice. Then she seemed to have thought of something, “Where’s the little rabbit?”

Ye Qingyu smiled and said, “At my house.”

“You don’t keep to your words.” There was a hint of disappointment that flashed by in Song Xiaojun’s eyes.

Here words were abrupt, but Ye Qingyu knew what she meant, because he had promised the little girl that he would definitely take good care of the little rabbit. He hurriedly explained, “Don’t worry, my aunt and sister will definitely take care of it. I wanted to come here and it's dangerous here so I could not bring it with me.”

Song Xiaojun answered with a nod, before she lowered her head again and did not speak.

Ximen Yeshui’s gaze flickered back and forth between Ye Qingyu and Song Xiaojun, and after a long while he said teasingly in a low voice, “Little Brother, your heart is beating so fast.”

Ye Qingyu’s lips were pressed together.

He really wanted to sew up Ximen Yeshui’s mouth.

At this time, Song Xiaojun looked up again, saying, “In a while, follow behind me.”

“Huh?” Ye Qingyu stood blank.

Given Song Xiaojun’s personality, she would not say something akin to ‘intimacy’.

“I will protect you,” Song Xiaojun continued.

Ye Qingyu suddenly understood. Song Xiaojun’s meaning was that she needed to protect him, so that he could stay alive to take care of the little rabbit.

What was this?

Could it be that in your heart, I am not as precious as the little rabbit?

Marquis Ye suddenly felt a little disappointed.

Ximen Yeshui seemed to feel like someone who had discovered a new continent. He began grinning roguishly, “There’s something fishy.”

Before his voice died away.

Bang!

A dark flame blasted the place where he stood.

A several meters deep pit appeared, and clouds of dark flame burst upward from the pit.

Ximen Yeshui, who evaded on time, was still recovering from the shock as he hurriedly shouted, “Stop, hurry stop... don’t misunderstand. I’m joking. I’m good friends with him... whoa, so violent...”

When the other strong people saw the clouds of dark flames, their expressions changed greatly.

“Unmoving City of Darkness?”

“You are... the holy girl of darkness?”

Someone looked astounded, retreating several steps back.

Given the experience of these people, of course it was impossible for them to not hear of the legend of the Unmoving City of Darkness. A while back, it was rumoured that even Lu Zhaoge was almost killed by this demon woman. Now, the people of Jianghu, at the mention of this name, all had completely different facial expressions.

Only Qin Zhishui’s eyes were flashing with a surprised expression.

He evidently was confused why a member of the Youyan Army, [The Leaf of Youyan], would be so close with the woman of darkness.

But at this moment, there was a bizarre change in the air.

Multicoloured light flashing in the sky.

In the originally dusky sky was a majestic shrine slowly emerging, like a mirage, gradually becoming much clearer and visible. The shrine, constructed of pure white bricks, was towering like a mountain that the dome of the shrine could not even be seen. The glistening white appearance gives the whole shrine a dazzling impression and an indescribable feeling of sanctity was exuding from the shrine itself.

All eyes immediately fell upon the shrine floating in mid-air.

In the front of the shrine was a double rectangular white stone gate, slowly rumbling open.

“The gate of the Moving Imperial Residence is finally open,” someone shouted excitedly.

Swoosh.

Light flashed and shadows flickered.

Countless figures, like lightning, were rushing to enter the slowly opening gate first.
