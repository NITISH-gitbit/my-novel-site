Chapter 789:


Chapter 806 - A Storm Is Brewing



"It looks like Ye Qingyu is going to battle all the way with the Black Moon Divine Palace..."

"Based on the current situation, they both seem to be evenly matched. No one can tell who will ultimately emerge as the winner..."

"Evenly matched? This is where you are mistaken. After all, the Black Moon Divine Palace is a major force with rich resources and a wide sphere of influence. Ye Qingyu is fighting alone; even if he is powerful, how strong could he ultimately be? If he is captured by Great Saint Zhong Yuan the moment he appears, I'm afraid the odds will be against him."

"Haha, that is where you are wrong. You might not be aware of it, but Ye Qingyu also has the support of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]."

Inferno City was all abuzz with excitement.

The crowd was waiting expectantly to see how this situation would play out.

The sudden appearance of an unknown character, who went up alone against an ancient sect with centuries of history and who managed to gain the upper hand at the moment, was a topic that generated a lot of interest. This was a potential legend in the making, therefore many experts who heard the news quickly made their way to the road of chaos, and many forces also secretly sent representatives to Inferno City to keep an eye on this development.

Sure enough, Ye Qingyu made his second announcement.

"There are limits to my patience. If you still refuse to hand Yang Wanqu over, I will seal all the representative stations of the Black Moon Divine Palace across the nineteen cities of chaos, and I will make sure that the Black Moon Divine Palace will never be able to face the rest of the Vast Thousand Domains."

Ye Qingyu's words were saved in a vocal rune that was suspended over Inferno City, and thus, his words were heard by countless people.

Following Ye Qingyu's words, the situation intensified.

Throughout the nineteen major cities of chaos, the Black Moon Divine Palace had representative stations in ten of them. Four representative stations had already been destroyed and the remaining six stations had gone on high alert, as though confronted by a formidable enemy. The Black Moon Divine Palace immediately sent powerful experts to support these stations, went on the highest state of alert, and engraved countless formations.

Time flew by.

Another four hours passed.

The sun had set and night had fallen.

Night fell quietly on the sixteenth city of chaos—Quicksand City.

Under the moonlight, Quicksand City looked like a gigantic sand dune, which was made up of ten majestic ancient divine mountains stacked up against each other. It was founded millions of years ago by a martial emperor of the Brute Race. Its sand was like running water that had the ability to travel thousands of meters into the sky, transforming into sand hurricanes that could swallow up everything.

"Boom!"

A loud sound was suddenly heard coming from a small mountain in the western part of Quicksand City.

"That is the direction of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative point!"

The surrounding experts felt chills run down their spines.

"Could the... rumors be true?

"Was that legendary young expert, Ye Qingyu, about to make another attack on the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative point?"

Many people were shocked.

Although Ye Qingyu already made the announcement earlier, many people had assumed it was just a mind trick—an empty threat. After all, he was single-handedly going up against an entire sect, so it would be extremely difficult for him to bring them down. However, were his words... about to become reality?

Almost all of the experts in Quicksand City who heard the news quickly made their way to the mountain in the western part of the city.

The Black Moon Divine Palace's representative point.

There was intense fighting there due to a surprise attack.

Extremely powerful auras burst out from the palace from time to time, which meant that ordinary experts were not able to get within a one-hundred-meter radius of the palace. The main gates of the palace, which were rock gates engraved with black moons, had been shattered, and the clang of swords clashing and soldiers yelling could be heard from within the palace.

"Ye Qingyu, you must be courting death!"

"Hurry up, quickly send for old ancestor Zhong Yuan!"

"Ah... lay out a formation to trap him! We mustn't let him escape."

As countless experts and disciples fought back frantically, undulating battle cries and wails from those who had been injured reached the ears of the experts who were observing the situation.

However, there were two extremely powerful figures right in the middle of the melee who moved freely like spirits. They were like tigers attacking a herd of sheep, and the experts from the Black Moon Divine Palace who had besieged them were nothing to them. In particular, a young man in white easily sent the Black Moon Divine Palace disciples, who were attacking in droves, flying. Blood sprayed everywhere, and those who were injured were unable to rejoin the battle.

A while later.

The sudden attack came to an end.

Just like the rumors had said, the two figures shot up into the air, overturned the plaque, and laid out an ice formation, immediately sealing this representative station of the Black Moon Divine Palace in ice. It was completely sealed and transformed into a mysterious ice mountain, then it disappeared into thin air.

It was over so quickly.

All those who had witnessed it were shocked by the power and speed of those two figures.

It was as though they were completely unstoppable and not one thing was able to affect their progress.

Although they did not unleash any powerful energy waves, their auras and vigor were powerful enough to instill fear into those who had been watching from the distance.

Less than five minutes later.

[Moon Chasing Fire Lord] Zhong Yuan and the other five Saint-level experts finally arrived, but it was too late.

There was nothing they could do about the situation.

There was no trace at all left of Ye Qingyu in the surrounding area.

"Ye Qingyu, I swear I will tear you to pieces and drink your blood!" Great Saint Zhong Yuan was outraged that the Black Moon Divine Palace had lost yet another representative station despite him personally attending to this matter. He was completely humiliated and it was really intolerable for him to have been played so easily by a junior.

"Go after him! He is definitely still within Quicksand City. We must capture this little bastard even if we have to turn the entire city upside down," bellowed the [Moon Chasing Fire Lord] angrily.

As the night drew on, the Black Moon Divine Palace experts and their allies were searching everywhere for suspicious characters.

The twinkling stars in the sky were like jewels that had been left behind on a curtain of darkness.

Zhong Yuan was extremely disappointed to know that although countless experts from the Black Moon Divine Palace and the surrounding land were constantly searching for traces of the duo, strangely, no one could capture a trace of their auras. Even when the Great Saint-level [Moon Chasing Fire Lord] used his secret technique, it was still to no avail.

These two people seemed to have completely vanished into thin air.

Yet another day passed.

On the morning of the second day, everyone on the road of chaos heard a shocking and alarming piece of news.

Four representative stations of the Black Moon Divine Palace near Quicksand City were mysteriously attacked by Ye Qingyu and were then sealed by his ice formation.

He had deployed similar methods and moved just as swiftly, then disappeared without a trace once again.

A young expert who had appeared out of nowhere had powerfully attacked the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative stations across five major cities at a speed that no one thought was possible.

Things were becoming more interesting.

Many people who had been gleefully keeping tabs on the situation finally realized how odd the situation was. The fact that six Great Saints of the Black Moon Divine Palace were unable to take down a young man of the Human Race left countless experts dumbfounded.

"How could this young man from the Human Race named Ye Qingyu be so powerful?"

Many people even started to suspect that Ye Qingyu was a successor of a super force who had been groomed in secret and was just now starting to show his true prowess. No one could believe that such a talented genius could emerge from a tiny and lowly domain.

As night fell, more and more theories and rumors started to spread.

Ye Qingyu's name and his unstoppable progress had become the hottest topic throughout the major cities. When the morning star twinkled over the firmament and a faint golden glow appeared on the skyline, the only representative station of the Black Moon Divine Palace that remained across the ten major cities was the one located in Falcon City.

Falcon City was a sprawling city on the road of chaos.

The most striking part of the city gates were the statues of two mythical beasts—the falcon and antelope, which were exquisitely carved from black rock and stood guard on the left and right sides of the city gates. They were hundreds of meters tall and stood as majestic as mountains. They looked extremely realistic as though they had been crafted by the most skillful craftsman.

These two statues of mythical beasts contained an age-old Dao essence and power of the primeval world, as though they had lived through the events of centuries past and had been around for thousands of centuries.

Every creation in this universe had its own laws of life and death and also lived by the laws of the jungle.

However, all living things that would normally be considered natural enemies in the Vast Thousand Domains lived together harmoniously in Falcon City and mutually respected each other. All foreign races and passers-by who first arrived in Falcon City would often see the peculiar sight of eagles and sheep, cats and mice, and leopards and oxen living harmoniously with one another.

Now, a fissure of tension could be sensed running through the most tranquil and peaceful city on the road of chaos.

Before dawn broke, the Black Moon Divine Palace had urgently issued a Black Moon Edict to the major forces across the myriad domains. This was the first time that one had been issued in many centuries.

This Black Moon Edict had traditionally been held by the Enforcement Elder and would not be issued unless absolutely necessary.

The fact that the Black Moon Divine Palace had urgently issued this edict showed that their upper echelons were incensed by Ye Qingyu's actions, a Heaven's Prideling from a tiny domain. Now was an extremely critical moment for the Black Moon Divine Palace.

Their edict invited experts of the various forces and lands to make their way to the city in order to defend the last representative station alongside the six Great Saints. After this matter was concluded, they would be rewarded with secret treasures from the Black Moon Divine Palace.

The Black Moon Divine Palace also released a statement declaring that they would capture Ye Qingyu and his accomplice and make them suffer ignoble deaths.

In just two days, all the various forces and experts within the road of chaos were aware of Ye Qingyu and the Black Moon Divine Palace's feud. This also led to more and more interest in the development of the situation and the situation with the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission.

Both sides were at an impasse, where neither side could back down.

Everyone knew that a storm was brewing but no one knew if this storm would trigger a massive flood that would sweep away all nineteen cities on the road of chaos.

Chapter 790:


Chapter 807 - Two Heads



"The Black Moon Divine Palace has been maligned. If Ye Qingyu did not deliberately slander us, then he would appear and speak with us face-to-face. The fact that he has not done so shows that he is guilty. We hope that all the various sects and our fellow martial artists will stand with us, the Black Moon Divine Palace, in annihilating this malicious punk from the lower domains."

These were the statements that the Black Moon Divine Palace continued to release to the foreign domains.

Ye Qingyu seemed to have vanished into thin air and no one could track him down at all. Furthermore, he had even consecutively destroyed the representative stations of the Black Moon Divine Palace across the major cities. This was a great insult to the Black Moon Divine Palace and they also felt immense pressure from Ye Qingyu's accusations. If they were indeed found guilty of launching a sudden attack on the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission, then they would find it hard to stomach the pressure from the Alliance of Domains. After all, they were not a super force, unlike the Four Stars Sect, the Divine Sky Sect, etc.

"Haha. How dare you ask me to make an appearance. Isn't it clear that you are going to kill me once I show up? You guys are just acting so innocent but I'm no fool. If Yang Wanqu appears, then I will also reveal myself because I can prove that he was the instigator behind the sudden attack on the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. Black Moon Divine Palace, do you dare accept this challenge?" Ye Qingyu also released a statement to the foreign domains. Shuang Wuyan had his own methods of masking Ye Qingyu's voice to the rest of the domains.

He was so insistent on demanding that Yang Wanqu make an appearance because he wanted to give them the wrong impression that he really had evidence and pile on the psychological pressure on the Black Moon Divine Palace. The more he did that, the more Yang Wanqu would refuse to show himself. The foreign domains would then start to find the Black Moon Divine Palace's actions suspicious and the public opinion would turn against them.

"Yang Wanqu is the successor of the Black Moon Divine Palace and was blessed with great fortune in the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool. He is currently in self-isolation in a bid to reach the Saint realm, so why would he make an appearance to attend to such frivolous matters at such a crucial time? That would only delay his progress, and we are sure Ye Qingyu is aware of this fact, having entered the 18th district together with our successor. He is only making such demands in order to deliberately destroy our successor's progression on the martial way. This is proof of his malicious intent."

The Black Moon Divine Palace retorted with a statement.

They made it clear that Yang Wanqu would not reveal himself and provided a logical reason for his actions. It was true that many people had been shocked and surprised that Yang Wanqu had come back to life from the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool, so it made sense that he was in self-isolation, processing whatever he had obtained from the 18th district.

"Ye Qingyu is really devious. I have received news that he is ambitious and that he betrayed the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission, deliberately slandered the Black Moon Divine Palace, and created this mess. In actual fact, he is the culprit of whatever happened to the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. It is also rumored that during his time in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he suppressed his dissidents and secretly cultivated his own following. No one knows how many innocent citizens of the Heaven Wasteland Domain he killed, and he was known as the 'Executioner' and 'Demon King' there..."  the master of Divine Life Sect said as he dragged Ye Qingyu's name through the mud.

Many people were stunned by his words.

Although the Divine Life Sect was not a large sect, it was largely known to act with integrity, so most people had a pretty good image of it. Furthermore, it was not known to be an ally of the Black Moon Divine Palace nor have any private dealings with them. Therefore, their words caused many people to reevaluate their impression of Ye Qingyu.
"Could this person just be a troublemaker?"

At the same time, the forces who were on good terms with the Black Moon Divine Palace also declared their support for them and said that they would capture the troublemaker Ye Qingyu, who had unreasonably provoked and slandered the Black Moon Divine Palace.

Suddenly, everyone started to hit Ye Qingyu while he was down.

Ye Qingyu's image was quickly tarnished and many people held him in contempt.

It was at this moment that a surprising turn in events occurred, which shocked many observers.

"Ye Qingyu is our friend and on good terms with our tribe," declared the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's guardian.

The statement was succinct, but the message and intent behind the words hinted at where the Phoenix Race stood.

Before they could process this information, the Black Demon Pool also made their statement. This time, the Princess of the Black Demon Race announced that Ye Qingyu was a good man and made it clear that they would stand on his side.

If the Phoenix Race had only hinted at their support for Ye Qingyu, then the Black Demon Race's princess had clearly taken Ye Qingyu's side, so whoever wanted to harm Ye Qingyu would now need to think twice.

It was also to many people's surprise that the first city of chaos, Sunrise City, which was led by the Human Race, was also seen within the city. When their representatives spoke to their allies, they only had good words to say about Ye Qingyu, and thought that he was a young genius of the Human Race who was of good moral character and skilled in martial arts.

This caused many people to be dumbfounded.

These were the words from a truly significant character.

Although these words were uttered during a banquet, who knew if the City Lord of Sunrise City had deliberately meant for them to become public knowledge. He hardly ever took a stance, so for someone of his stature to make such a statement, the meaning behind his words was clear enough.

A young Heaven's prideling from a tiny domain had suddenly obtained the support of two super forces and a large city, and thus, he was now evenly matched with the Black Moon Divine Palace in terms of support. In fact, Ye Qingyu's side had the advantage in terms of power and support.

The situation had become even more tricky. Many large forces who had been observing the situation now did not dare to openly take sides and adopted a wait-and-see approach.

Soon after, it was the afternoon of the third day.

The three-day deadline that Ye Qingyu had set was now coming to an end.

Falcon City—

The representative station of the Black Moon Divine Palace was located on a street in the northern part of the city.

Many experts had gathered from across the land and were now standing guard alongside the six Great Saints.

Countless experts and representatives of the various forces were also observing the situation from the surrounding areas and from the Void.

However, the perpetrator of this, Ye Qingyu, had yet to show himself.

Those who were hidden away in the Void and were completely shrouded in mist could not help chattering amongst themselves.

"Do you think this punk named Ye Qingyu has been scared off by this situation?"

"I don't think so. After all, the Phoenix Race and Black Demon Pool have voiced their support for him. Either one of these two super forces could easily destroy the Black Moon Divine Palace."

"However, I heard... that the Black Moon Divine Palace has the support of the Mizar, and the Mizar Race is on good terms with the Four Stars Sect..."

"It is probably no longer a matter of seeking vengeance. The large forces behind this might use it as a chance to declare war..."

"It is odd that the Alliance of Domains has yet to make a statement after Ye Qingyu has created such a huge commotion. Could he also have the support of the Alliance?"

"I don't think so. How could a domain without a grade garner the support of the Alliance of Domains?"

"I think the same. Let's just wait and see. The deadline of three days is almost up..."

While the spectators were discussing it animatedly, there was a sudden commotion at the representative station of the Black Moon Divine Palace down below.

The bloody heads of two experts from the Human Race, whose eyes had been gouged out, were suddenly placed on a wooden pole in front of the gates of the representative station. Their faces had been completely disfigured and knife marks could be seen all over their bloodied heads.

A middle-aged man clad in the robes of the Black Moon Divine Palace, with ash-colored hair, bull-like eyes, and a burly body that gave off cruel qi, announced loudly, "These two people were the accomplices of the rogue Ye Qingyu and had been captured alive by the Saints of the Black Moon Divine Palace. They were killed after we interrogated them and their heads have been placed here as a warning to all!"

"Boom!"

The crowd reacted to this piece of news just like how ice water reacts to hot oil.

The surrounding crowd was all abuzz.

"What? He had other accomplices? Wasn't there only an elderly man by his side?"

"His accomplices have been killed? Is Ye Qingyu about to be defeated?"

"Did his accomplices have a hand in the previous incident where he simultaneously destroyed several representative stations across several large cities?"

"Isn't Ye Qingyu a human from a tiny domain? Why does he suddenly have accomplices?"

The crowd was all abuzz as everyone clamored to express their suspicions and views.

The Saint stationed in front of the Black Moon Divine Palace seemed pleased with the crowd's reaction. An almost undetectable radiance flashed through his eyes.

At the same time, a thousand meters north of the representative station, on the roof of a restaurant—

Two figures stood side by side on a red-tiled roof beam. They were completely shrouded within a thin layer of mist and had become one with the Void. Neither a slight ripple or a trace of aura could be detected from them, as though a drop of water had fallen into a river, and they remained completely undetectable.

These two figures who looked at the representative station of the Black Moon Divine Palace from a distance were none other than Ye Qingyu and Shuang Wuyan, who had eluded all of the experts from the various large forces in search of them.

As Ye Qingyu stared at the two blooded heads hanging from a pole in front of the gates of the representative station, his eyes glimmered with two rays of purple light. It was as though a fireball was constantly churning in his heart and his eyes were practically burning with rage.

He recognized those two heads.

They were the heads of the King of the Brute Race, Shi Potian, and the top warrior of the Brute Race, Jin Tuodao!

Ye Qingyu had almost grounded his teeth to pieces.

He was completely incensed.

He wanted to rush forward but Shuang Wuyan held him back.

"Stay calm." The chubby elderly man shook his head.

Ye Qingyu's eyes were spitting fire but he forced himself to stand back.

At this moment, he was almost completely certain that the Black Moon Divine Palace had been one of the forces that had attacked the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. It was also likely that by choosing to display the heads of the members of that envoy mission, the Black Moon Divine Palace was conveying a message to them.

The remaining members of the envoy mission were probably being held captive by them as well.

This was their way of forcing Ye Qingyu to reveal himself.

"What should I do?"

Ye Qingyu stared into the distance, unable to make up his mind.

He was already consumed with rage.

By displaying the heads of the members of the envoy mission publicly, it was not just a great insult to the deceased for them to have died with dismembered body parts, but it also caused Ye Qingyu to be filled with great remorse and self-reproach. He could not hold back the urge to rush over, destroy all the representative stations of the Black Moon Divine Palace, and retrieve the bodies of the two deceased warriors of the Brute Race.

"Don't act rashly," Shuang Wuyan said coldly and dispassionately, as though he had sensed the anger emanating from Ye Qingyu beside him.

Those words contained an icy qi that immediately doused the flames of anger that were consuming Ye Qingyu. His gaze slowly focused and he became much more clear-headed.

========================================

Chapter 791:


Chapter 808 - Watch Me Destroy the Black Moon Divine Palace
Ye Qingyu realized that this was the most crucial moment.
The Black Moon Divine Palace had made a reckless move by displaying the heads of the King of the Brute Race. Although by doing so they would fan the flames of his anger, this could also be proof that they had indeed suddenly attacked the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. These two people had been important characters in the envoy mission. And although they had been deliberately disfigured beyond recognition, Ye Qingyu had identified them immediately.
It was not difficult to deduce that many traps had probably been laid out at the representative station at the moment, with countless experts lying in wait. The Black Moon Divine Palace must have spared no expense laying out an elaborate trap that was bound to kill him if he were to rush in rashly.
To capture a big fish, one must abandon the bait.
There was a high possibility that the remaining members of the envoy mission, including Xing'er, would be killed.
At the thought of that happening, Ye Qingyu completely calmed down.
He turned to look at Shuang Wuyan and asked, "Elder Shuang, what should we do now?"
Ye Qingyu had not run out of ideas to deal with the grim situation they faced, but rather, so many ideas had flashed through his mind that he found himself unable to decide how they should proceed in order to launch a safe rescue mission.
His concern had clouded his judgment, and so, even the usually calm and collected Ye Qingyu was uncertain of his next move. He looked toward Shuang Wuyan since this elder was more experienced and familiar with the Alliance of Domains.
"Let's wait a little longer."
Shuang Wuyan stared calmly and seriously into the distance, as though he was waiting for something.
Ye Qingyu nodded.
As he looked at the gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station, his heart was consumed with fury and his eyes sparkled with fire. He found it hard to tamp down the killing intent in his heart and he knew that he had to do something as soon as possible.
Thirty minutes later, there was another commotion from the representative station.
In front of the gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station—
Someone carried something out and soon after, another head was hung from the Black Moon pole.
Ye Qingyu's heart dropped.
Similarly, this head had its eyes gouged out. However, upon closer inspection, despite his matted hair and clotted blood, Ye Qingyu recognized that head as that of Left Minister Qu Hanshan. As one of the important men of the Snow Empire, Ye Qingyu was familiar with how Qu Hanshan looked and thus recognized him straight away. It was truly his head and it was not a decoy.
Has Qu Hanshan also been killed?
This goddamn Black Moon Divine Palace.
Ye Qingyu started to shake all over.
He felt as though every single one of his pores was spitting fire. The rage and killing intent threatened to consume him and he had a sudden impulse to destroy everything.
"Black Moon Divine Palace..." Ye Qingyu ground his teeth so hard that an audible grinding sound could be heard. His voice rumbled forth like fire as he completely let himself be consumed by anger. "I swear that I will destroy this entire sect and wipe it from the face of this world. I swear that I will destroy its gates and that I will make sure that the Black Moon Divine Palace's existence will only be found in history!"
Then, he turned to look at Shuang Wuyan and said, "I'm about to do something and I won't need your help in this. Please help me carry out a task that is very important. If you manage to complete this task I've entrusted you with, I will live. If not, I will vanish from this world alongside the Black Moon Divine Palace."
Shuang Wuyan looked at Ye Qingyu.
He could tell that Ye Qingyu had already made up his mind and there was no further room for discussion. After spending these few days with him, Shuang Wuyan had to admit that this young man was the most remarkable Heaven's prideling he had encountered throughout all the domains. Ye Qingyu was outstanding in all aspects, so he believed that even though Ye Qingyu was consumed by rage, he was still capable of sound judgment and would not rashly court death.
"Alright, what would you like me to do?" Shuang Wuyan nodded. "I will definitely accomplish this task as long as I don't die."
......
......
In the assembly hall of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station—
"Mister Zhu, we have set up everything according to your instructions." The elder in charge of this representative station, Zheng Hong, reported as he saluted a thin, middle-aged scholar with a black beard who held a rainbow fan made of feathers from a divine bird. "I have already displayed the three heads that you have brought."
"Alright, I understand. Tell everyone to remain on their guard and prepare to act according to plan once Ye Qingyu makes his appearance."
Zheng Hong nodded and left the hall to disseminate Mister Zhu's instructions.
"Will Ye Qingyu really take the bait and show himself?" one of the five Great Saints asked curiously.
"Of course, I have it all planned out." Mister Zhu waved his fan, full of confidence. He smiled proudly and continued, "Of course, as long as everyone present follows my instructions and refrains from acting rashly and the middle segment goes smoothly, we will definitely be able to capture this bastard from the lower domain. Then, it's up to you how you want to deal with him."
"Hmph." One of the Saints scoffed.
The entire representative station was now under the control of Mister Zhu and even the Saints had to act according to Mister Zhu's instructions. It was said that the palace master had been very unhappy with the current situation and thus sent Mister Zhu to oversee everything here. Mister Zhu was not part of the Black Moon Divine Palace, but the reason he had been entrusted with such an important mission was that he had defeated the rest of his competitors to become the master of the personal disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace—Yang Wanqu.
Some people were willing to submit to this calculating Mister Zhu, who was only at the Immortal Step realm, while some were not willing to submit to him. Even within the Great Saints, there were some who disapproved of Mister Zhu's presumptuous attitude. But since no one dared to defy the palace master's orders, they could only submit to him.
On the opposite side, Great Saint Zhong Yuan sat in repose with his eyes closed.
He looked as though he had no interest in the happenings of the foreign domain, but instead, he had his own concerns. At his age, unless he had heaven-defying progress in terms of his martial cultivation and managed to find himself on the emperor's road, all his efforts would come to naught. Therefore, what he was most concerned about was not his own lifespan, but whether the Black Moon Divine Palace would be able to reach a period of great prosperity.
The Black Moon Divine Palace had dozens of successors amongst the younger generation and Yang Wanqu was one of the outstanding ones among the group, but he was definitely not the most outstanding. Zhong Yuan had not thought much of Yang Wanqu, but after his return from the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool, he had improved by leaps and bounds, defeating the rest of his competitors to become the personal disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace. His current standing within the Black Moon Divine Palace was only second to the palace master and would be an extraordinary successor to the palace master in the future.
Great Saint Zhong Yuan had thought highly of Yang Wanqu's transformation.
He was also very supportive of a young man like Yang Wanqu to succeed the palace master.
As for Mister Zhu, Zhong Yuan could not pinpoint what exactly was wrong with him. Logically speaking, since he was Yang Wanqu's master and Yang Wanqu was a candidate he admired, all should have been well. Mister Zhu had also shown that he was doing his best to support Yang Wanqu, but because Mister Zhu was not a disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace, Zhong Yuan felt that something was off about Mister Zhu.
Even though he was a veteran Great Saint, Zhong Yuan could not determine Mister Zhu's background and the ancestry of his techniques.
I hope he's sincere about supporting Yang Wanqu and that he's not here to cause trouble. Otherwise, if I determine that he has ulterior motives, I will definitely kill myself,
Zhong Yuan thought.
At that moment—
Zheng Hong rushed back into the hall, his face flushed with excitement. He was so overcome with excitement that he lost his composure and loudly announced, "Mister Zhu, Elder Zhong, and the rest of the Saints, he has appeared. He has truly appeared..."
"Who has appeared?" One of the Saints rose to his feet and stared hard at Zheng Hong. "Speak clearly. What is the urgency?"
"Yes, yes." Zheng Hong knew that he had lost his composure earlier on and continued, "Ye Qingyu has appeared. This bastard from the lower domain has indeed made his appearance. He is currently cursing outside the manor and declared that he will take those three heads away with him."
"What?"
"Is that true?"
The rest of the Saints could not contain their excitement.
Zhong Yuan's eyes opened and a brilliant murderous spirit flashed across his ancient and cloudy eyes.
He slowly rose to his feet and steadily walked outside without saying a word. His aura was filled with immense pressure which caused the others to hold their breaths for a moment.
"Haha, he appeared a little earlier than expected. Ye Qingyu has let me down, I guess I had thought too highly of him earlier." Mister Zhu laughed, his face filled with disdain. He rose to his feet and said, "Let's go, everyone. The rest of you are up next. If you don't have the confidence, then it would be safer to lure this bastard into our trap and capture him thereafter."
Everyone made their way outside.
In front of the outer gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station—
A young man in white stood outside silently.
He was surrounded by hundreds of Black Moon Divine Palace's disciples, who lay collapsed all around him. The casualties were high.
The young man in white did not continue to kill. He held the three heads that had been displayed on the poles moments earlier, his body trembling and his eyes shining with tears, as he muttered, "To the two kings, please blame me for my incompetence in preventing your deaths. However, I swear to you that the Brute Race of the Heaven Wasteland Dynasty will flourish and thrive and will no longer be enslaved. Left Minister Qu Hanshan, as you watch from the heavens, I will avenge your death and destroy the Black Moon Divine Palace."
Chapter 808 - Watch Me Destroy the Black Moon Divine Palace



Ye Qingyu realized that this was the most crucial moment.

The Black Moon Divine Palace had made a reckless move by displaying the heads of the King of the Brute Race. Although by doing so they would fan the flames of his anger, this could also be proof that they had indeed suddenly attacked the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. These two people had been important characters in the envoy mission. And although they had been deliberately disfigured beyond recognition, Ye Qingyu had identified them immediately.

To capture a big fish, one must abandon the bait.

There was a high possibility that the remaining members of the envoy mission, including Xing'er, would be killed.

At the thought of that happening, Ye Qingyu completely calmed down.

He turned to look at Shuang Wuyan and asked, "Elder Shuang, what should we do now?"

Ye Qingyu had not run out of ideas to deal with the grim situation they faced, but rather, so many ideas had flashed through his mind that he found himself unable to decide how they should proceed in order to launch a safe rescue mission.

His concern had clouded his judgment, and so, even the usually calm and collected Ye Qingyu was uncertain of his next move. He looked toward Shuang Wuyan since this elder was more experienced and familiar with the Alliance of Domains.

"Let's wait a little longer."

Shuang Wuyan stared calmly and seriously into the distance, as though he was waiting for something.

Ye Qingyu nodded.

As he looked at the gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station, his heart was consumed with fury and his eyes sparkled with fire. He found it hard to tamp down the killing intent in his heart and he knew that he had to do something as soon as possible.

Thirty minutes later, there was another commotion from the representative station.

In front of the gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station—

Someone carried something out and soon after, another head was hung from the Black Moon pole.

Ye Qingyu's heart dropped.

Similarly, this head had its eyes gouged out. However, upon closer inspection, despite his matted hair and clotted blood, Ye Qingyu recognized that head as that of Left Minister Qu Hanshan. As one of the important men of the Snow Empire, Ye Qingyu was familiar with how Qu Hanshan looked and thus recognized him straight away. It was truly his head and it was not a decoy.

Has Qu Hanshan also been killed?

This goddamn Black Moon Divine Palace.

Ye Qingyu started to shake all over.

He felt as though every single one of his pores was spitting fire. The rage and killing intent threatened to consume him and he had a sudden impulse to destroy everything.

"Black Moon Divine Palace..." Ye Qingyu ground his teeth so hard that an audible grinding sound could be heard. His voice rumbled forth like fire as he completely let himself be consumed by anger. "I swear that I will destroy this entire sect and wipe it from the face of this world. I swear that I will destroy its gates and that I will make sure that the Black Moon Divine Palace's existence will only be found in history!"

Then, he turned to look at Shuang Wuyan and said, "I'm about to do something and I won't need your help in this. Please help me carry out a task that is very important. If you manage to complete this task I've entrusted you with, I will live. If not, I will vanish from this world alongside the Black Moon Divine Palace."

Shuang Wuyan looked at Ye Qingyu.

He could tell that Ye Qingyu had already made up his mind and there was no further room for discussion. After spending these few days with him, Shuang Wuyan had to admit that this young man was the most remarkable Heaven's prideling he had encountered throughout all the domains. Ye Qingyu was outstanding in all aspects, so he believed that even though Ye Qingyu was consumed by rage, he was still capable of sound judgment and would not rashly court death.

"Alright, what would you like me to do?" Shuang Wuyan nodded. "I will definitely accomplish this task as long as I don't die."

......

......

In the assembly hall of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station—

"Mister Zhu, we have set up everything according to your instructions." The elder in charge of this representative station, Zheng Hong, reported as he saluted a thin, middle-aged scholar with a black beard who held a rainbow fan made of feathers from a divine bird. "I have already displayed the three heads that you have brought."

"Alright, I understand. Tell everyone to remain on their guard and prepare to act according to plan once Ye Qingyu makes his appearance."

Zheng Hong nodded and left the hall to disseminate Mister Zhu's instructions.

"Will Ye Qingyu really take the bait and show himself?" one of the five Great Saints asked curiously.

"Of course, I have it all planned out." Mister Zhu waved his fan, full of confidence. He smiled proudly and continued, "Of course, as long as everyone present follows my instructions and refrains from acting rashly and the middle segment goes smoothly, we will definitely be able to capture this bastard from the lower domain. Then, it's up to you how you want to deal with him."

"Hmph." One of the Saints scoffed.

The entire representative station was now under the control of Mister Zhu and even the Saints had to act according to Mister Zhu's instructions. It was said that the palace master had been very unhappy with the current situation and thus sent Mister Zhu to oversee everything here. Mister Zhu was not part of the Black Moon Divine Palace, but the reason he had been entrusted with such an important mission was that he had defeated the rest of his competitors to become the master of the personal disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace—Yang Wanqu.

Some people were willing to submit to this calculating Mister Zhu, who was only at the Immortal Step realm, while some were not willing to submit to him. Even within the Great Saints, there were some who disapproved of Mister Zhu's presumptuous attitude. But since no one dared to defy the palace master's orders, they could only submit to him.

On the opposite side, Great Saint Zhong Yuan sat in repose with his eyes closed.

He looked as though he had no interest in the happenings of the foreign domain, but instead, he had his own concerns. At his age, unless he had heaven-defying progress in terms of his martial cultivation and managed to find himself on the emperor's road, all his efforts would come to naught. Therefore, what he was most concerned about was not his own lifespan, but whether the Black Moon Divine Palace would be able to reach a period of great prosperity.

The Black Moon Divine Palace had dozens of successors amongst the younger generation and Yang Wanqu was one of the outstanding ones among the group, but he was definitely not the most outstanding. Zhong Yuan had not thought much of Yang Wanqu, but after his return from the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool, he had improved by leaps and bounds, defeating the rest of his competitors to become the personal disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace. His current standing within the Black Moon Divine Palace was only second to the palace master and would be an extraordinary successor to the palace master in the future.

Great Saint Zhong Yuan had thought highly of Yang Wanqu's transformation.

He was also very supportive of a young man like Yang Wanqu to succeed the palace master.

As for Mister Zhu, Zhong Yuan could not pinpoint what exactly was wrong with him. Logically speaking, since he was Yang Wanqu's master and Yang Wanqu was a candidate he admired, all should have been well. Mister Zhu had also shown that he was doing his best to support Yang Wanqu, but because Mister Zhu was not a disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace, Zhong Yuan felt that something was off about Mister Zhu.

Even though he was a veteran Great Saint, Zhong Yuan could not determine Mister Zhu's background and the ancestry of his techniques.

I hope he's sincere about supporting Yang Wanqu and that he's not here to cause trouble. Otherwise, if I determine that he has ulterior motives, I will definitely kill myself,
Zhong Yuan thought.

At that moment—

Zheng Hong rushed back into the hall, his face flushed with excitement. He was so overcome with excitement that he lost his composure and loudly announced, "Mister Zhu, Elder Zhong, and the rest of the Saints, he has appeared. He has truly appeared..."

"Who has appeared?" One of the Saints rose to his feet and stared hard at Zheng Hong. "Speak clearly. What is the urgency?"

"Yes, yes." Zheng Hong knew that he had lost his composure earlier on and continued, "Ye Qingyu has appeared. This bastard from the lower domain has indeed made his appearance. He is currently cursing outside the manor and declared that he will take those three heads away with him."

"What?"

"Is that true?"

The rest of the Saints could not contain their excitement.

Zhong Yuan's eyes opened and a brilliant murderous spirit flashed across his ancient and cloudy eyes.

He slowly rose to his feet and steadily walked outside without saying a word. His aura was filled with immense pressure which caused the others to hold their breaths for a moment.

"Haha, he appeared a little earlier than expected. Ye Qingyu has let me down, I guess I had thought too highly of him earlier." Mister Zhu laughed, his face filled with disdain. He rose to his feet and said, "Let's go, everyone. The rest of you are up next. If you don't have the confidence, then it would be safer to lure this bastard into our trap and capture him thereafter."

Everyone made their way outside.

In front of the outer gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station—

A young man in white stood outside silently.

He was surrounded by hundreds of Black Moon Divine Palace's disciples, who lay collapsed all around him. The casualties were high.

The young man in white did not continue to kill. He held the three heads that had been displayed on the poles moments earlier, his body trembling and his eyes shining with tears, as he muttered, "To the two kings, please blame me for my incompetence in preventing your deaths. However, I swear to you that the Brute Race of the Heaven Wasteland Dynasty will flourish and thrive and will no longer be enslaved. Left Minister Qu Hanshan, as you watch from the heavens, I will avenge your death and destroy the Black Moon Divine Palace."

Chapter 792:


Chapter 809 - Courting Death?



Countless people had their eyes fixed on the young man in white who stood outside the gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace.

Falcon City was now as lively as a pot of boiling water.

The fact that both sides had continuously released statements pushed the entire situation to a climax that no one had thought was possible, and everyone looked forward to how things would develop. Both Ye Qingyu and the Black Moon Divine Palace had adopted a tough stance and also received the support of many forces. Many people now realized this was no longer just a matter of a small fry from a lower domain taking on an ancient sect, but had now turned into a proxy fight amongst the top-level sects, which had remained quiet for far too long in the nineteen cities on the road of chaos.

Therefore, hundreds of thousands of experts from across the land had gathered at the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station. They were either observing in plain sight or were hidden away, but they were all closely observing the development of this situation.

That young man in white suddenly walked out from the Void, and as he drew closer to the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station, many people realized that the end was near.

After Ye Qingyu snatched the heads of the three experts from the Heaven Wasteland Domain, a terrifyingly powerful aura immediately appeared as Great Saint Zhong Yuan walked toward him like an enraged lion. Everyone could sense his rage and killing intent. His terrifying aura was like a boundless sea, which threatened to grind Ye Qingyu into a fine powder.

"Son of a bitch, you finally dared to reveal yourself."

Zhong Yuan's eyes narrowed as he spoke, his voice was piercingly sharp like a knife.

Ye Qingyu did not even look at Zhong Yuan.

He gently breathed out a mouthful of air and frosty ice crystals immediately froze the heads of Qu Hanshan and the rest. A layer of ice that was as transparent as the finest jade covered these three heads and contained them safely within.

"My friends," Ye Qingyu said softly, "Rest assured, I will bring you back to the Heaven Wasteland Domain and return your souls to your homeland. I will make sure that the dreams we had fought for will come true. I will accomplish your unfulfilled dreams and destroy whoever stands in our way, no matter who they might be."

On the opposite side—

Behind the Great Saint Zhong Yuan stood the five Great Saints of the Black Moon Divine Palace, Zheng Hong, and the others, and they were standing in an indistinct crescent moon shape around Ye Qingyu. Their eyes shone with excitement because they had finally seen the troublemaker who had brought about so much unrest to the Black Moon Divine Palace.

"You speak so confidently," the head of Falcon City's representative station, Zheng Hong, said. "You said that you would destroy whoever stood in your way; who do you think you are? You are just a lowly troublemaking citizen from the lower domain. How dare you speak so arrogantly!"

"Haha." Ye Qingyu carefully put the three heads away, and when he looked up, his anger and sorrow slowly faded away and was replaced by an intense killing intent and rage that consumed him. "You are just a lowly person in charge of a representative station, an ordinary Saint, so what do you know? How dare you speak to me here! You're just a pathetic worm, get out of my sight," he retorted sarcastically.

"You..." Zheng Hong sputtered exasperatedly.

His status was indeed far lower than that of Zhong Yuan and the five Great Saints. He was not even as powerful as the experts who had gathered to watch the developments, let alone those from the super forces who had released statements in support of both sides. All he wanted to do was put his importance on display on such a significant occasion, but instead, he had now been greatly insulted by Ye Qingyu. How could he remain calm?

Zheng Hong was about to say something, but Great Saint Zhong Yuan gestured to him to remain silent, so Zheng Hong could only reluctantly swallow his words.

"Son of a bitch, aren't you a smartass? No matter how eloquently you speak today, you will still die." Great Saint Zhong Yuan's aura was extremely strong as he prepared to kill Ye Qingyu. He could not wait to kill this malicious character who had brought so much shame to the Black Moon Divine Palace, but he held himself back.

He knew that many forces were keeping tabs on this situation and Ye Qingyu had the support of several super forces, so if he killed Ye Qingyu immediately without giving him the chance to speak, it would seem as though the Black Moon Divine Palace had rushed to silence Ye Qingyu. This would not bode well for their image if they were to kill him without letting him speak at all after demanding for him to appear.

Mister Zhu, who had been gently waving his fan, also nodded slightly and let out a sigh of relief.

He had been afraid that Great Saint Zhong Yuan would pay no heed to his instructions and kill Ye Qingyu in a fit of anger. This would disrupt the rest of his plan and all his efforts would be wasted.

He had already laid out his plan perfectly. As long as Ye Qingyu tried to make his accusations, he was confident that he would be able to completely tarnish the image of this peasant from a lowly domain and ensure that his image would never be able to recover. This would be a beautiful reversal for the Black Moon Divine Palace, and it could immediately change everything in their favor.

Mister Zhu smiled a little too arrogantly.

He had great confidence in his intellect and his plans. Furthermore, his master had entrusted him with immense authority and given him an unimaginably large amount of resources to carry out this mission. This was only the first part of his plan, and Mister Zhu was sure that he had laid out the perfect plan. As someone who took immense pleasure in tricking people, Ye Qingyu's actions and reactions had all gone according to his plan. Thus, he was sure that there would be no exception this time around.

However...

"Speak? To hell with you." Ye Qingyu looked at those of the Black Moon Divine Palace scornfully and cursed. He had never experienced such intense hatred before and this was the first time he had the urge to kill everything in sight. "You bastards, you are part of the Human Race; the blood of the descendants of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors and of the heroic Human Race flows through your veins. You enjoy the freedom and the status of the Human Race that your ancestors fought for, but is there anything left in your brains? Is it filled with dog shit? Shouldn't you rejoice at the appearance of a domain led by the Human Race? Wasn't it a sign of how the Human Race was getting stronger? Why must you make things difficult for the Humans of Heaven Wasteland Domain time and time again? Why do you bully people of your own race, your comrades with the same blood? Did you do it for the shameless gains in that dog-shit brain of yours? Or was it for the filthy power that you craved? Or was it for the treasures and gains I have obtained from the 18th district? You are just a pack of short-sighted jackals. The Human Race is on the decline but instead of fighting for its relevance, you have attacked your own kind. You are worst than beasts... I have nothing else to add but I will tell you that I will not die today. Instead, I will make sure that the Black Moon Divine Palace is erased from the Vast Thousand Domains and will rot in the depths of hell. There is no longer any need for your existence."

Ye Qingyu's patience had run out.

He felt like vomiting as he stared at these people.

Kill.

Only by killing could the souls of the dead be put to rest and could light return to the world. Words had lost their power and purpose, he would only be able to achieve justice with violence.

"Kill!"

He clenched his fists and they sparked with splendor. The [Dragon Blood Halberd] and the [Blood Drinker Sword] appeared in hands, then he turned into a bolt of lightning and charged at the group of Black Moon Divine Palace men, with Great Saint Zhong Yuan as his first target.

Mister Zhu's face changed.

He could not imagine how the normally calm and collected Ye Qingyu could act so rashly and stupidly at such a crucial moment. By choosing to attack directly, he was courting death. Were his calculations wrong or did Ye Qingyu have another hidden card up his sleeve?

It was too late now to give this matter further thought because Zhong Yuan was now unable to hold himself back.

"Die, bastard!" he bellowed.

He raised his hand and countless formation beams sparkled crazily. Each beam contained the power and mystery of the Great Saint, and it seemed to contain enough power to crush the surrounding space. A power that resembled the laws and mystery of the universe swept through the surrounding area, as though a fiendgod had descended from the heavens. Zhong Yuan was intensely attached to the Black Moon Divine Palace because he had been part of the palace all his life, so he would not stand for such a grave insult to the Black Moon Divine Palace.

The countless people surrounding the representative station sighed.

They had been expecting an exciting battle with the forces that supported each side making their move to attack. They had not expected Ye Qingyu to be such a hothead and to act so rashly, which meant that this matter that had rocked the Vast Thousand Domains was about to come to an anticlimactic ending. After all, Zhong Yuan was a Great Saint.

However...

"Boom!"

There was an earth-shattering explosion that swept through the surroundings.

Zhong Yuan's chain of formation shattered inch by inch.

He looked up in a daze and saw that a huge, ancient bronze cauldron had appeared above Ye Qingyu's head.

It shone with a mysterious splendor and turned continuously, its ancient drawings barely distinguishable. Yellow silk ribbons dangled from the cauldron and shielded Ye Qingyu within it. This huge cauldron was what caused his magical formation to shatter.

"Kill!"

Although Ye Qingyu had blocked the Great Saint's attack and had been protected by the [Cloud Top Cauldron], he still felt an intense feedback force. He was still not powerful enough to wield this cauldron to its fullest potential. Most of the time, the cauldron relied on its own devices to protect him. But despite blocking the blow, he had sustained serious injuries and blood flowed from the corners of his mouth.

Without hesitation, he transformed into flowing light and used his [Flowing Shadow Kill] technique. His figure alternated between real and imaginary, as though it was about to disappear from this world. After all, it was a beautiful magical ability from the [Fiendgod Titled Chart] of the bronze book, so he managed to evade Great Saint Zhong Yuan and appear in the midst of the disciples of the Black Moon Divine Palace.

Although he had destroyed the representative stations of the Black Moon Divine Palace, Ye Qingyu had not killed anyone because their disciples were all from the Human Race.

However, now that he was consumed by rage, he no longer had such an inhibition and he killed freely.

He slashed out frantically with his [Dragon Blood Halberd] and his [Blood Drinker Sword] and produced a [Sword Tempest] that rolled across the heavens. Loud cries rang out as dozens of Black Moon Divine Palace's experts were slashed into minced meat, including Zheng Hong, who was a half-Saint.

"Goddamnit..." Great Saint Zhong Yuan was stunned and quickly attacked once again.

Ye Qingyu did not give him any window of opportunity. His figure flashed mysteriously and became impossible to track. He moved extremely quickly, just like a tiger chasing a herd of sheep, and soon after, charged into the premises of the representative station.

"Hmm?" Mister Zhu was slightly taken aback.

He had reacted quickly earlier and thus managed to evade Ye Qingyu's sword. He had survived despite everyone around him dying. When he saw Ye Qingyu rushing into the representative station, he was unable to wrap his head around it. There were all kinds of formations and traps laid out within the representative station, including many experts lying in wait within. This was something that even an idiot could figure out, so why did Ye Qingyu rush headlong into the trap as though he did not fear death?

The next moment, something strange happened.

From the depths of the representative station, bright red flames suddenly rose into the heavens from the direction that Ye Qingyu had disappeared.

What was that?

The faces of the countless onlookers changed rapidly when they saw the flames that consumed the place.
