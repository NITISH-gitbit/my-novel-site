Chapter 477:


There was probably only one reason——
A major part of Ye Qingyu’s mind was sealed by the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
This directly affected Ye Qingyu’s yuan qi cultivation, decreasing it to only three or four Spirit springs.
In other words, Ye Qingyu had not met the conditions of reaching the Bitter Sea stage as per his father’s last words.
This should be the reason for the lack of response from the broken bluestone table in the temple.
Maybe when the seal has been lifted, and his yuan qi had been restored to the Bitter Sea stage, then he could come to the Ancestral temple again and really solve all the mysteries and uncover the truth.
Sitting on the back of a crane and overlooking the mountains and streams of the small world below, Ye Qingyu’s great disappointment was gradually fading and his mood began to improve.
His hands were playing with a light blue stone.
This was a piece that he picked up during his first entry into the empty Ancestral temple space.
The pattern on the stone was exquisite, and the faint blue colour, under the sunlight resembled jade. There was a translucent pure blue light arc which seemed able to absorb the heat of the sun, gradually becoming warmer.
They arrived at the exit of the small world, where the yellow airship had been waiting for a long while.
“Fellow, thank you.”
Ye Qingyu jumped off the back of the crane and stroked its head.
The cranes, reluctant to part, were affectionately rubbing their head against Ye Qingyu and when that Ye Qingyu was about to turn around to leave, they grabbed onto his sleeve with their beak, uttering a soft cry.
“Huh?” Ye Qingyu looked at the two cranes.
Yu Xiaoxing instantly understood. “Hehe, cousin, it seems they like you, they want to follow you around.”
“Follow me around?” Ye Qingyu was slightly taken aback. “They are spiritual birds inside the ancestral land, they can choose their Master? They can leave the little world of the ancestral land?”
“Of course they can, some nobles in the Imperial capital keep spiritual birds in their residence. The majority are from the small world of the Ancestral land. The Imperial family would also reward misters who had achieved notable merits with spiritual birds.” Yu Xiaoxing could tell that Ye Qingyu was tempted, and said grinning, “You are of Imperial blood, and had provided great service to the Empire in the Battle of the Light City, it would not be a problem if you take one or two of them away.”
“In that case, it would be disrespectful to refuse.” Ye Qingyu was in a good mood.
These two cranes were enormous, with steel-like feathers, and posses extraordinary strength, but most importantly they could fly at an extremely fast speed and were compatible with him.
“Come on, fellows, if you are willing, then follow me,” Ye Qingyu beckoned to the two cranes.
The crane danced merrily, uttering long cries of excitement.
But only one crane chose Ye Qingyu, while the other crane chose to follow Yu Xiaoxiang.
Yu Xiaoxing was laughing happily.
“Red crowned cranes are a precious type of spiritual birds in the Ancestral land, only a small number is bred in the Ancestral land but also a very few would choose their own master. Our visit to the Ancestral land this time was well worth it.”
Instead of boarding the airship, she jumped onto the crane’s back.
Ye Qingyu also did not get on the ship.
Wouldn’t riding a crane be much faster?
……
An hour later.
Ye Qingyu returned to the City of Light.
As soon as he landed, he received shocking news.
“Foreign experts have arrived,” Gao Han reported to Ye Qingyu in the first instance. “Three hours ago, there were lights flashing above the [Domain’s Heavenly Wall], and the Central Domain Gate opened. Tens of foreign young experts came to Light City through the Domain Gate.”
“What?”
Ye Qingyu exclaimed inwardly.
Foreign forces had finally arrived at Heaven Wasteland Domain?
But why would the first batch of people to enter Heaven Wasteland Domain be a group of youngsters?
“Where are they?” Ye Qingyu asked calmly.
“The Right minister is personally seeing them. He brought the group of youngsters to the Imperial guards camp.” Gao Han had gathered thorough information before reporting. “It looks like these guys are humans. When they appeared, every one of them was like a bird startled by the mere twang of a bowstring, but later they became extremely arrogant.”
“Arrogant? How arrogant?” Ye Qingyu asked while walking.
“Once they knew of the situation, they requested to see His Majesty. They claimed that they are the disciples of the Greater One Sect of the Clear Water Domain. Each and every one of them was insufferably arrogant. I heard that they even pointed at and criticized the Right Minister.”
Gao Han purposely lowered his voice.
Clear River Domain?
Greater One Sect?
What kind of power was that?
Ye Qingyu was a little puzzled.
But the good news was that the first batch of foreign forces arriving at Heaven Wasteland Domain was humans, so there was no need to worry about a large-scale invasion of other races.
“This group of youngsters, although arrogant, are very strong. The majority is at the high level of the Bitter Sea stage and some are Heaven Ascension experts. We can’t underestimate them, and they kept calling us inferior indigenous people...”
Gao Han recounted the current situation.
“Let’s go and have a look first.”
Ye Qing headed toward the Imperial army camp.
The so called Imperial army camp was the temporary camp of elite Imperial guards stationed within 300 miles of the Light City.
The reason for Right Minister and others bringing the youngsters of the Great One Sect in here was obvious. Before they became aware of their background and their aim of coming here, they must first treat them with caution.
By being in the Imperial guards camp, if they clashed, the many formation experts could take control of the situation in the first instance.
The Imperial guards camp had tight security.
But with Ye Qingyu’s status, he was allowed to go in and out freely.
Very quickly, the huge main tent of the Imperial camp was distantly in sight.
From a distance, thousands of elite experts could be seen intentionally patrolling the main tent, all kinds of formations were in an activated state and the atmosphere was much more solemn and tenser than usual.
“Lord!”
Seeing Ye Qingyu coming over, several elite experts hurriedly saluted.
Ye Qingyu nodded in reply, then casually asked, “How is the situation?”
“These brats are very arrogant, caused a big uproar, and are now demanding to compete against the experts and masters of the empire in a martial arts contest. I say we first arrest them and mercilessly beat them up, then they will behave.” An Imperial General was panting with rage.
His strength was not considered weak. He was at the peak of the Bitter Sea stage but had a fiery temper. It seemed he could not hold back his anger anymore.
Ye Qingyu smiled and was about to say something, when he heard a burst of wild laughter coming from the Imperial army’s main tent.
“Inferior indigenous people are inferior indigenous people, simply weak and pitiful. Are these the so-called experts in your army? You cannot withstand even a single blow...”
“You...” someone roared.
“What? You don’t agree? I see there are more than fifty of you, but you’re all only of the Bitter River stage. In our Clear Water Domain, even mediocre trash could reach your level at around fifty years old, too weak, haha, just like ants. You could not even withstand a casual move from me, trash like you might as well die, why are you still alive?”
There was undisguised arrogance in that voice.
Ye Qingyu slightly nodded, making his way towards the Imperial army’s main tent.
The Imperial army General hurriedly stretched his hand out to stop him. “Palace Lord Ye, the Right Minister said that when you return you should not hurry over to see these foreign domain people, wait until...”
Ye Qingyu smiled. “Don’t worry, I know about Right Minister’s concern, I’ll go talk to him, I won’t make things difficult for you.”
“Then...” The Imperial General was a little hesitant.
Ye Qingyu patted him on the shoulder, smiling faintly, and headed straight into the main tent.
Ye Qingyu of course understood Lin Zheng’s thinking.
He was worried that now that Ye Qingyu’s strength had significantly weakened, if he came into contact with these foreign domain people and the two sides clashed, he could not protect Ye Qingyu.
Speaking of which, it was quite funny.
The Lin Zheng before would want to hack Ye Qingyu into thousands of pieces, but now he was protecting him almost like a son, worried that someone would lay a finger on him.
Watching Ye Qingyu enter the main tent, the Imperial army General had stretched his hand out into mid-air, but finally shook his head and did not say anything.
After the first war of Light City, although others may not know about Ye Qingyu’s remarkable feat, the Imperial army had all heard about it. The entire Imperial army was full of admiration and respect for this young Palace Lord.
……
The moment Ye Qingyu stepped foot into the main tent, there was a pungent stench of blood in the tent.
More than ten youngsters in dark, tight battle robes were sitting, standing or leaning against something, laughing and joking. Each and every one had a condescending attitude, as though they were watching a play.
These youngsters were radiating an extremely strong aura, which were distinctly different from the martial arts of Heaven Wasteland Domain, seemingly very treacherous.
But as they were joking and chatting, one could tell that their language was only slightly different to the official language of the Snow Empire of Heaven Wasteland Domain. It was clear and comprehensible but what they said were not good words.
Right Minister, Left Minister and the Old Commander looked a little irritated.
This was especially so for the old Commander Li Guangbi, who was well-known for his fiery temper. He had already stood up and slammed his fist on the table, and his face was red with rage.
In the middle of the huge tent stood a young man with three moles on his clear and pale cheeks.
This three-moled young man was also dressed in the style of foreign domain people, black, tight battle robes, arm guards, a protective chest armour, leg protectors and battle boots. He exhibited an imposing manner as he casually stood there with hands on the front of his chest and a ridiculing expression on his face.
And opposite of him were several armour-clad Imperial army experts.
These several Imperial army Generals had all sustained light injuries, with blazing fury in their eyes as they supported a seriously injured middle-aged General.
Ye Qingyu recognized the General who was supported by everyone.
His name was Huang Tianxiang.
During the Battle of Light City a few months ago, Ye Qingyu had met and battled shoulder to shoulder with him.
This was a tough man who was born into a sect family, then joined the Imperial army and achieved notable military merits. He was 55 years old, but because of his profound martial arts cultivation base he looked only around thirty years old.
Huang Tianxiang was considered a strong core power of the Imperial army.
But at this moment, one of his arms was cleanly severed off from the elbow.
The bone of the severed arm was exposed, blood dripping out, and the stench of blood was filling the huge tent. The flesh around the wound was a dark grey colour like rotten meat. It was evidently being corroded by a very malicious strange power.
And the youngster with three moles was stepping on the severed hand.
The three moled foreign domain youngster had the corners of his mouth tilted up in a mocking and oppressive curve, as he said disdainfully, “What? Angry? Haha, how about you all fight together, if you can push me away, I will give him back this arm, how about that? Hahaha!”

There was probably only one reason——
A major part of Ye Qingyu’s mind was sealed by the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
This directly affected Ye Qingyu’s yuan qi cultivation, decreasing it to only three or four Spirit springs.
In other words, Ye Qingyu had not met the conditions of reaching the Bitter Sea stage as per his father’s last words.

========================================

Chapter 478:


Chapter 498, Murderous intent surging
“You...”
“Too arrogant!”
The several Imperial guard experts were losing their temper.
They had lost to this black-moled youngster in a fight. The strength of these foreign domain people was unexpectedly powerful, and their moves were extremely strange. If they were caught off guard, they would suffer a great deal.
Since they were not as skilled as the opponents, they had nothing to say.
But this black-moled youngster’s actions were too infuriating.
After he won, he acted so arrogant and ungraceful and didn’t have a trace of poise; he had simply gone too far.
Facing such provocation, their comrades receiving insults, it was like a direct slap to their face. The several hot-blooded fellows could not stand it any longer.
But they were only soldiers. Previously, they received the order to battle to test the strength of these arrogant foreign domain people. Without the command from their superior, they could only let their veins pop and emit puffs of breath in anger.
“Haha, inferior people are inferior people, a little trigger and you’re like a dog that’s been stepped on its tail.” The black-moled youngster laughed, hooked his fingers together, his attitude was extremely frivolous and disdainful. “Unfortunately, your strength is too bad, how can you...”
As he spoke, he turned his head around and cast a glance at Ye Qingyu who had just came in.
Sensing Ye Qingyu’s pitiful yuan qi cultivation base, the black-moled youngster thought he was some sort of scholar and simply did not pay much attention to him.
He sneered while turning his head back to look at Right Minister and the others, “Hey, old people, these are the experts of your domain? Complete shambles. What we said before, have you thought about it? Tell your emperor to get over here and present the Imperial seal, join our Greater One Sect, this is the blessing of a lifetime...”
“Shut up, brat.” Li Guangbi shattered the table into powder with the palm of his hand.
Qu Hanshan hastily pulled him back.
Lin Zheng’s expression was motionless, a trace of evil intent flickered across his eyes.
Given his usual style and temper, if it was someone else that dared to be so impudent, he most likely would have beheaded him already.
But today these people, after all, were the first group of people that came to the Heaven Wasteland Domain through the opening of the Central Domain Gate. Before they figured out their origins and details, he had to tolerate them for now.
Lin Zheng had always planned carefully before he acted. When he needed to tolerate he would tolerate till the end.
But when he saw Ye Qingyu coming in, he could not help the look of surprise that crossed his face. Then immediately, as though he realized something, a trace of helplessness made its way across his face.
Given Ye Qingyu’s identity, if he wanted to enter, the Imperial Generals obviously could not stop him.
Moreover, such a choice was indeed more in line with Ye Qingyu’s temper.
It would be no use even if Lin Zheng tried to persuade him.
Ye Qingyu waved, walked over to the front of the several Imperial military experts, and lightly patted their shoulders without saying anything. He held Huang Tianxian’s arm and carefully examined the grey brilliance produced from the wound, from which he smelled a scent of decay…
These disciples of the Greater One Sect cultivated in such evil cultivation technique. It seems the Greater One Sect was not any benevolent sect.
Ye Qingyu thought to himself.
He fully activated the three Spirit springs in the barren world of his
dantian
, mobilizing a trace of [Supreme Ice Flame] to cover the wound on Huang Tianxiang's severed arm...
Threads of ice crystals were silvery white as the moonlight.
The black-moled young man was slightly taken aback for a moment then burst out laughing, “You... what are you doing? Trying to cure his injury... hahaha, You? Haha, this is the biggest joke I’ve ever seen, a less than three Spirit spring trash wants to cure the poison of [Decaying Qi]...”
“Hahaha...”
The other foreign domain youngsters also collapsed into laughter.
“The indigenous people of this little place are not as good as even the dogs of our Clear River Domain, haha. It’s too funny...” One of the disciples was bent forward clutching his belly and laughing uncontrollably, tears rolling down his cheeks.
“A four spirit spring brat... Ahahaha, so pitiful, or should I say he’s arrogant or should I say he’s a stupid pig.”
“Hey, everybody don’t laugh, stay quiet for a moment, watch carefully, what if he really could cure it.” Another Great One Sect disciple greatly resisted the urge to mock and said with a deadpan expression, but in the end could not help bursting into laughter again.
The gaze that the disciples of the Great One Sect looked at Ye Qingyu with was like watching a clown.
Qu Hanshan hurriedly held old Commander Li Guangbi back, worried that this fiery-tempered lion would mess things up.
Lin Zheng took a deep breath and was about to say something, but suddenly he realized something, narrowed his eyes, and did not say a word, and instead quietly watched Ye Qingyu.
Watching Huang Tianxiang’s severed arm being shrouded in cold air and silk-like threads of silver, and beginning to burn.
There was nothing happening in the beginning.
But after three or four seconds, Huang Tianxiang suddenly felt that the pain from his severed arm being corroded by the [Decaying Qi], which was similar to a poisonous spider eating into his bone, was suddenly gone, replaced by a slight coolness and an extremely comfortable feeling.
In others’ eyes, there was actually a different scene.
The pale grey mist and decaying odour were shattered bit by bit by the silk-like silver light, as though silvery flames were setting fragments of grey on fire. In the blink of an eye, all the grey mist was completely incinerated, and not even the slightest decaying odour remained.
Huang Tianxiang’s wound revealed scarlet red flesh and white bones.
Without the strange power of corrosion, Huang Tianxiang naturally could endure this sort of pain with his strength. His complexion grew rosy and his breathing immediately turned steady.
The several Imperial guard experts were overjoyed at the unexpected good news.
Lin Zheng and the others all breathed a sigh of relief.
“Thank you Palace Lord...” Huang Tianxiang immediately bowed to express his gratitude.
He knew that he had come back from the gates of hell.
With his strength of the Bitter Sea stage, the regeneration of flesh and limbs was not a difficult thing at all.
Opposite.
The dozens of Great One Sect disciple were all dumbfounded.
The words that they had just uttered were now seemingly turning into an invisible palm, mercilessly slapping their faces, that they could no longer say anything else. The mockery, ridicule, disdain and provocative smile, all froze on their faces, that it seemed as though they had an inexpressible embarrassed expression.
“You...” The black-moled Great One Sect disciple was finally willing to look at Ye Qingyu in the eye, as he said clenching his teeth, “Who are you... How did you... how can you dispel the power of [Decaying Qi]?”
Ye Qingyu did not say a word.
Although his current yuan qi was for some reason sealed by the [Cloud Top Cauldron] so he only possessed the strength of around three or four Spirit springs, and a part of [Supreme Ice Flame] was also subsequently sealed, his mastery of [Supreme Ice Flame] had long reached the point of perfection. Compared to the time when he was healing the formerWar God of Youyan Pass Lu Zhaoge, he was now many times more skillful. The treatment of the so-called [Decaying Qi] needed only seconds.
His gaze fell on the arm that the black-moled young man was treading on. He stretched out his hand and uttered, “Give it over.”
The black-moled youngster was taken aback for a few moments before those words sank in.
Ye Qingyu’s calm and indifferent expression had infuriated him, causing anger to rise from his heart.
With a cold smirk, the black-moled young man turned to face Ye Qingyu, hooking his fingers, as he said, “Boy, are you deaf? Did you hear what I just said? If you want that trash’s hand, you can come take it if you can.”
Ye Qingyu walked over one step at a time.
There was an abrupt change of expression on Lin Zheng and the others’ faces.
Several Imperial military Generals hurriedly blocked Ye Qingyu’s path.
After the war of Light City, Ye Qingyu withstood against the Divine Lightning Punishment, causing his martial arts foundation to be destroyed and his cultivation base to deteriorate. Although they were forbidden to discuss about it, the majority of the Imperial army still knew about it.
“Lord... think carefully.”
“Lord, there is no need for you to personally deal with this sort of matter.”
The Imperial Generals did not know what to say.
Lin Zheng gave a wry smile, flashing over to block Ye Qingyu’s path. “Palace Lord Ye, why get annoyed over these little things, wait till your strength is restored...”
Before he finished his words, Ye Qingyu twisted his head round, cast a glance at him, and said, “Minister Lin, do you think I’m a reckless person who disregards the consequences? Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.”
Lin Zheng was dumbstruck.
He was screaming in his mind ‘if you’re not a reckless person who disregards the consequences you would not have made that move when you fought against the divine lightning.’
But for some reason, Lin Zheng hesitated.
He summoned the [White Tiger Armour], transformed it into a white tiger that crouched on his shoulder and no longer stopped Ye Qingyu, but his heart was pounding in nervousness. As soon as Ye Qingyu ran into any danger, he could provide assistance in the first moment.
These so-called Great One Sect disciples were from a foreign domain and the matter was very serious, but if it really endangers Ye Qingyu’s life, Lin Zheng could not care about it too much.
He exchanged a meaningful glance with Qu Hanshan and Li Guangbi behind him.
As soon as the situation did not feel right, they must immediately kill all these Great One Sect disciples, destroy their bodies and wipe away all evidences, let them vanish from earth in order to avoid a disaster from happening in the future.
The atmosphere in the tent suddenly grew tense.
At this moment, Ye Qingyu was three steps away from the black-moled youngster. He stretched out his hand and directly grabbed the black-moled young man’s arm.
This grasp did not carry the slightest yuan qi.
There was a cold grin on the black-moled young man’s face. He remained calm and collected but in the depths of his eyes there was a glow of murderous intent frantically flashing.
The fact that Ye Qingyu had dispelled his [Decaying Qi] technique before had already evoked his killing intent.
Right now Ye Qingyu was so boldly attacking him, causing killing intent to surge.
“Boy, you want to die.”
The black-moled young man roared inwardly. As Ye Qingyu five fingers clutched his wrist, suddenly he flipped his wrist around and grabbed Ye Qingyu’s wrist. There was a devilish grin on his face as he suddenly exerted force to crush Ye Qingyu’s wrist into blood and flesh...
Ye Qingyu seemed unable to react, letting him grab his wrist.
“Not good...” Huang Tianxiang cried out.
But when he wanted to save him, it was too late——
Chapter 498, Murderous intent surging
“You...”
“Too arrogant!”
The several Imperial guard experts were losing their temper.

After he won, he acted so arrogant and ungraceful and didn’t have a trace of poise; he had simply gone too far.
Facing such provocation, their comrades receiving insults, it was like a direct slap to their face. The several hot-blooded fellows could not stand it any longer.
But they were only soldiers. Previously, they received the order to battle to test the strength of these arrogant foreign domain people. Without the command from their superior, they could only let their veins pop and emit puffs of breath in anger.
“Haha, inferior people are inferior people, a little trigger and you’re like a dog that’s been stepped on its tail.” The black-moled youngster laughed, hooked his fingers together, his attitude was extremely frivolous and disdainful. “Unfortunately, your strength is too bad, how can you...”
As he spoke, he turned his head around and cast a glance at Ye Qingyu who had just came in.
Sensing Ye Qingyu’s pitiful yuan qi cultivation base, the black-moled youngster thought he was some sort of scholar and simply did not pay much attention to him.
He sneered while turning his head back to look at Right Minister and the others, “Hey, old people, these are the experts of your domain? Complete shambles. What we said before, have you thought about it? Tell your emperor to get over here and present the Imperial seal, join our Greater One Sect, this is the blessing of a lifetime...”
“Shut up, brat.” Li Guangbi shattered the table into powder with the palm of his hand.
Qu Hanshan hastily pulled him back.
Lin Zheng’s expression was motionless, a trace of evil intent flickered across his eyes.
Given his usual style and temper, if it was someone else that dared to be so impudent, he most likely would have beheaded him already.
But today these people, after all, were the first group of people that came to the Heaven Wasteland Domain through the opening of the Central Domain Gate. Before they figured out their origins and details, he had to tolerate them for now.
Lin Zheng had always planned carefully before he acted. When he needed to tolerate he would tolerate till the end.
But when he saw Ye Qingyu coming in, he could not help the look of surprise that crossed his face. Then immediately, as though he realized something, a trace of helplessness made its way across his face.
Given Ye Qingyu’s identity, if he wanted to enter, the Imperial Generals obviously could not stop him.
Moreover, such a choice was indeed more in line with Ye Qingyu’s temper.
It would be no use even if Lin Zheng tried to persuade him.
Ye Qingyu waved, walked over to the front of the several Imperial military experts, and lightly patted their shoulders without saying anything. He held Huang Tianxian’s arm and carefully examined the grey brilliance produced from the wound, from which he smelled a scent of decay…
These disciples of the Greater One Sect cultivated in such evil cultivation technique. It seems the Greater One Sect was not any benevolent sect.
Ye Qingyu thought to himself.
He fully activated the three Spirit springs in the barren world of his
dantian
, mobilizing a trace of [Supreme Ice Flame] to cover the wound on Huang Tianxiang's severed arm...
Threads of ice crystals were silvery white as the moonlight.
The black-moled young man was slightly taken aback for a moment then burst out laughing, “You... what are you doing? Trying to cure his injury... hahaha, You? Haha, this is the biggest joke I’ve ever seen, a less than three Spirit spring trash wants to cure the poison of [Decaying Qi]...”
“Hahaha...”
The other foreign domain youngsters also collapsed into laughter.
“The indigenous people of this little place are not as good as even the dogs of our Clear River Domain, haha. It’s too funny...” One of the disciples was bent forward clutching his belly and laughing uncontrollably, tears rolling down his cheeks.
“A four spirit spring brat... Ahahaha, so pitiful, or should I say he’s arrogant or should I say he’s a stupid pig.”
“Hey, everybody don’t laugh, stay quiet for a moment, watch carefully, what if he really could cure it.” Another Great One Sect disciple greatly resisted the urge to mock and said with a deadpan expression, but in the end could not help bursting into laughter again.
The gaze that the disciples of the Great One Sect looked at Ye Qingyu with was like watching a clown.
Qu Hanshan hurriedly held old Commander Li Guangbi back, worried that this fiery-tempered lion would mess things up.
Lin Zheng took a deep breath and was about to say something, but suddenly he realized something, narrowed his eyes, and did not say a word, and instead quietly watched Ye Qingyu.
Watching Huang Tianxiang’s severed arm being shrouded in cold air and silk-like threads of silver, and beginning to burn.
There was nothing happening in the beginning.
But after three or four seconds, Huang Tianxiang suddenly felt that the pain from his severed arm being corroded by the [Decaying Qi], which was similar to a poisonous spider eating into his bone, was suddenly gone, replaced by a slight coolness and an extremely comfortable feeling.
In others’ eyes, there was actually a different scene.
The pale grey mist and decaying odour were shattered bit by bit by the silk-like silver light, as though silvery flames were setting fragments of grey on fire. In the blink of an eye, all the grey mist was completely incinerated, and not even the slightest decaying odour remained.
Huang Tianxiang’s wound revealed scarlet red flesh and white bones.
Without the strange power of corrosion, Huang Tianxiang naturally could endure this sort of pain with his strength. His complexion grew rosy and his breathing immediately turned steady.
The several Imperial guard experts were overjoyed at the unexpected good news.
Lin Zheng and the others all breathed a sigh of relief.
“Thank you Palace Lord...” Huang Tianxiang immediately bowed to express his gratitude.
He knew that he had come back from the gates of hell.
With his strength of the Bitter Sea stage, the regeneration of flesh and limbs was not a difficult thing at all.
Opposite.
The dozens of Great One Sect disciple were all dumbfounded.
The words that they had just uttered were now seemingly turning into an invisible palm, mercilessly slapping their faces, that they could no longer say anything else. The mockery, ridicule, disdain and provocative smile, all froze on their faces, that it seemed as though they had an inexpressible embarrassed expression.
“You...” The black-moled Great One Sect disciple was finally willing to look at Ye Qingyu in the eye, as he said clenching his teeth, “Who are you... How did you... how can you dispel the power of [Decaying Qi]?”
Ye Qingyu did not say a word.
Although his current yuan qi was for some reason sealed by the [Cloud Top Cauldron] so he only possessed the strength of around three or four Spirit springs, and a part of [Supreme Ice Flame] was also subsequently sealed, his mastery of [Supreme Ice Flame] had long reached the point of perfection. Compared to the time when he was healing the formerWar God of Youyan Pass Lu Zhaoge, he was now many times more skillful. The treatment of the so-called [Decaying Qi] needed only seconds.
His gaze fell on the arm that the black-moled young man was treading on. He stretched out his hand and uttered, “Give it over.”
The black-moled youngster was taken aback for a few moments before those words sank in.
Ye Qingyu’s calm and indifferent expression had infuriated him, causing anger to rise from his heart.
With a cold smirk, the black-moled young man turned to face Ye Qingyu, hooking his fingers, as he said, “Boy, are you deaf? Did you hear what I just said? If you want that trash’s hand, you can come take it if you can.”
Ye Qingyu walked over one step at a time.
There was an abrupt change of expression on Lin Zheng and the others’ faces.
Several Imperial military Generals hurriedly blocked Ye Qingyu’s path.
After the war of Light City, Ye Qingyu withstood against the Divine Lightning Punishment, causing his martial arts foundation to be destroyed and his cultivation base to deteriorate. Although they were forbidden to discuss about it, the majority of the Imperial army still knew about it.
“Lord... think carefully.”
“Lord, there is no need for you to personally deal with this sort of matter.”
The Imperial Generals did not know what to say.
Lin Zheng gave a wry smile, flashing over to block Ye Qingyu’s path. “Palace Lord Ye, why get annoyed over these little things, wait till your strength is restored...”
Before he finished his words, Ye Qingyu twisted his head round, cast a glance at him, and said, “Minister Lin, do you think I’m a reckless person who disregards the consequences? Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.”
Lin Zheng was dumbstruck.
He was screaming in his mind ‘if you’re not a reckless person who disregards the consequences you would not have made that move when you fought against the divine lightning.’
But for some reason, Lin Zheng hesitated.
He summoned the [White Tiger Armour], transformed it into a white tiger that crouched on his shoulder and no longer stopped Ye Qingyu, but his heart was pounding in nervousness. As soon as Ye Qingyu ran into any danger, he could provide assistance in the first moment.
These so-called Great One Sect disciples were from a foreign domain and the matter was very serious, but if it really endangers Ye Qingyu’s life, Lin Zheng could not care about it too much.
He exchanged a meaningful glance with Qu Hanshan and Li Guangbi behind him.
As soon as the situation did not feel right, they must immediately kill all these Great One Sect disciples, destroy their bodies and wipe away all evidences, let them vanish from earth in order to avoid a disaster from happening in the future.
The atmosphere in the tent suddenly grew tense.
At this moment, Ye Qingyu was three steps away from the black-moled youngster. He stretched out his hand and directly grabbed the black-moled young man’s arm.
This grasp did not carry the slightest yuan qi.
There was a cold grin on the black-moled young man’s face. He remained calm and collected but in the depths of his eyes there was a glow of murderous intent frantically flashing.
The fact that Ye Qingyu had dispelled his [Decaying Qi] technique before had already evoked his killing intent.
Right now Ye Qingyu was so boldly attacking him, causing killing intent to surge.
“Boy, you want to die.”
The black-moled young man roared inwardly. As Ye Qingyu five fingers clutched his wrist, suddenly he flipped his wrist around and grabbed Ye Qingyu’s wrist. There was a devilish grin on his face as he suddenly exerted force to crush Ye Qingyu’s wrist into blood and flesh...
Ye Qingyu seemed unable to react, letting him grab his wrist.
“Not good...” Huang Tianxiang cried out.
But when he wanted to save him, it was too late——

Chapter 479:


The black-moled young man grabbed at Ye Qingyu's wrists, and fiercely squeezed.
At that instant, he could already imagine that he would very quickly hear the sounds of the bones in Ye Qingyu's hand snapping and breaking, hear the sounds of Ye Qingyu's tragic screams...
But, the next moment, the rebounding force that came from his palm made the black-moled youth realize that something was not quite right.
At the moment when he twisted, Ye Qingyu's hand did not even move in the slightest.
"Eh?" There was a shocked complexion that appeared on the youth's face, then he sneered: "I underestimated you... but, to think you dare to resist. Originally, I was only going to cripple your hand, but right now, I will hack apart your entire limb..."
As he finished, he subconsciously used an even greater force to twist at Ye Qingyu's palm.
Bu Ye Qingyu's wrist did not even budge even with that.
"How is this possible? You..." The complexion of the black-moled youth finally changed.
At that moment, he finally began to realize something was not right.
The youth held Ye Qingyu's wrist, and felt that what he grabbed was not made from flesh and blood, but divine steel. No matter how much he exerted strength, there was no way he would be able to move Ye Qingyu's wrist in the slightest.
"Impossible... little trash, I'll cripple you." The black-moled youth suddenly felt embarrassed and angry.
His face turned vicious. Letting out a low grunt and using force, he grabbed at Ye Qingyu's palm with both his hands. Within his palm, there was a yuan qi light madly surging, instantly exploding with his strongest strength. He wanted to completely tear off Ye Qingyu's arm.
But at this time, Ye Qingyu also moved.
Like it was premeditated, his wrist faintly twisted. Ye Qingyu's right palm lighty broke free of the grip of the youth hands.
At this moment, the black-moled youth could only feel an extremely powerful power that began exploding from within his palms. It caused all his fingers to go numb, losing all sensation. He had no way of gripping onto Ye Qingyu's hands anymore.
And before he could react, Ye Qingyu once again struck out.
It was a simple grab.
The right hand of the black-moled youth, was held by Ye Qingyu's hand.
With a twist.
Ka-cha.
The sound of bone breaking could be heard.
The black-moled youth was stunned, then instantly began squealing like a pig being slaughtered.
HIs right hand, at that moment, was snapped by Ye Qingyu like snapping a branch of rotten wood. It was completely broken. Then with a sharp sound, the broken hand of the black-moled youth was torn apart from his arm like tearing fabric.
There was deathly white bone, as well as spurting fresh blood.
Although this was not the most brutal scene they had witnessed, for some unknown reason, everyone's heart suddenly quivered.
The main point was that Ye Qingyu's face was still calm and expressionless even until then. It could not help but make the hearts of the people who were familiar with him shake a little.
Casually throwing the torn off hand by the side, Ye Qingyu lifted his hand and lightly pushed.
The black-moled youth that was screaming was suddenly like a kite that had it's string cut. He could not help but fly back. Amidst a series of cold gasps, Ye Qingyu bent down and picked up the chopped off hand of Huang Tianxiang.
Before anyone could react, Ye Qingyu returned the cut off hand back to Huang Tianxiang.
A Bitter Sea stage expert had the power to make flesh regrow. But this was a process that was extremely wasteful of blood qi and power. One could lose years and even tens of years of cultivation. In the battle of the Light City, Lin Zheng was hurt till he only had his head left, then made his body regrow. In truth, this had wasted nearly twenty years of bitter cultivation. Afterwards, with the power of the Spirit pill that Yu Junhan gave, only then did he manage to forcibly recover.
But if one took the cut off body part and reconnected it, then the process would become much easier.
"Thank you, Lord."
Huang Tianxiang was somewhat dumbfounded. He subconsciously received his chopped off hand.
He really could not think this through. In the rumours, had the martial arts foundation of Palace Lord Ye not already have been destroyed, and his yuan qi was crippled?
But why was it... that the Greater One Sect disciple, had such a powerful strength? Previously, he had already defeated consecutive experts form the Imperial army. But in the blink of an eye, like he was a young child, his hand was torn apart by Palace Lord Ye.
Everything was somehow unrealistic.
Ye Qingyu patted him on the shoulder without saying anything.
But at this time, the other Greater One Sect disciples, finally reacted.
"Junior brother, are you okay?"
"He broke your hand? And quickly reconnected it like that?”
There were some Greater One Sect disciples that quickly huddled over. They supported the black-moled youth that was screaming on the ground, that could not even crawl up. There was someone that brought his torn off hand over, and help him reconnect it at the first instant.
At this time, there was someone who discovered that there was a clear palm indent on the chest of the black-moled youth. It must be from the push that Ye Qingyu casually did. It had even left a palm imprint, even with the power of his fleshly body and the fact that he was protected by yuan qi.
This... just what was this power?
There were several Greater One Sect disciples that fell mute from surprise.
The other Greater One Sect disciples' first reaction was to charge and surround Ye Qingyu as well as the experts of the Imperial army. All of them had extremely furious expressions. The gaze they looked at Ye Qingyu with was like looking at an impudent slave that dared to resist against his master.
"You little trash, you dared to hurt someone?"
"Why are you wasting words with him. First capture him, and cripple his yuan power, then we can dispose of him at our leisure."
"Hehe, little brat, do you want to surrender yourself, or do you want to make me act and drag you out."
Some Greater One Sect disciples directly acted. Their fingers outstretched, five surging yuan qi pillars formed a new attack that headed towards Ye Qingyu's body.
The power at the peak of the Bitter Sea stage exploded unquestionably at this instant.
"Protect his lord!"
"Impudence!"
There were some experts of the Imperial army that let out angry shouts.
Ye Qingyu smiled, taking a step forward.
The moment his foot landed on the ground, he suddenly exerted strength. An invisible pure air vibration exploded and moved the Imperial army expert protecting in front of him away. He lifted his hand and swiped. Without the slightest of yuan qi fluctuation, the surging yuan qi net was like a torn fabric, casually ripped apart by him.
"What?"
Everyone who saw this was dumbfounded.
This scene was really too unbelievable.
To so casually rip apart the power of yuan qi. But the problem was that Ye Qingyu's swipe clearly did not have any yuan qi within it. Just what had happened?
Before the others could have any reaction, Ye Qingyu took another step forward. With his fingers outstretched, he slapped.
"One must return a favour with a favour. You also receive one of my moves."
There was a faint gust of wind brought about by his palm. It did not have the slightest of yuan qi turbulence within it.
The Greater One Sect disciples that had just acted all had smiles of contempt and disdain on their faces. "Little brat, what kind of demonic technique did you use just now... haha,you don't even have requirements to make me receive one of your moves...”
Before he had even finished.
Pak!
A light sound emitted.
Ye Qingyu's palm, landed directly on one of the Greater One Sect disciples chest.
These Greater One Sect disciples were like a piece of wood that was struck by an extremely powerful hammer. He was dumbfounded, not understanding why he was flying out.
The protective yuan qi that he was so proud of did not even halt Ye Qingyu's palm in the slightest or pose the slightest of blockage.
With his cultivation at the pinnacle of the Bitter Sea stage, he had absolutely no way of withstanding a slap that seemed so light and powerless. The moment he landed, half of his face was like a swollen rotten peach. There were several white tooths that flew out, his face changing shape...
"Brat, you dare..."
"To dare harm my junior disciple, you are looking to die.”
"Kill him.”
Seeing such a scene caused some Greater One Sect disciples to grow furious.
Ye Qingyu did not say anything and did not retreat but advanced instead. He went directly over and lifted his hand to slap. Without hurry or slowing down, slap after slap struck out.
Pak!
The sound of the slaps were clear and loud.
Another Greater One Sect disciple was sent flying.
"You..."
There were some Greater One Sect disciple that had their eyes open in rage.
They were like snails that had fallen into a swamp. Their eyes were open wide as they watched Ye Qingyu's palm approach, but they had no way of evading. Even if they used all their power, and their yuan qi that was half a step into the Heaven Ascension stage activated madly to it's fullest, it could not block that palm in the slightest.
As the lines of that palm became clearer and clearer and more distinct, they felt as if a steel hammer was striking at their ear. With a bang, everyone felt their vision blackening, stars appearing as they were sent flying in a semi conscious state.
Pah! Pah! Pah!
One after another, Greater One Sect disciple were becoming like logs of rotten wood. Without the chance to resist, with no way of blocking even a single strike, they were all sent flying by Ye Qingyu's slaps.
The Ye Qingyu at this moment was like a War God had possessed his body. His might could not be stopped.
From top to bottom, there was not the slightest of yuan qi fluctuation on his body, as if he was a normal person. But the moves he had held terrifying power. There was not lightning, nor fire or smoke, but no matter what, the Greater One Sect disciples had no way of blocking it in the slightest. They could only see the slap mercilessly landing on their own faces.
At this time, there was enraged roars and screams in the great tent.
One Greater One Sect disciple was sent flying.
Two Greater One Sect disciples rushed forward.
Three Greater One Sect disciples were sent hurtling backwards.
Four Greater One Sect disciples charged forward...
In the great tent, the clear noise of slaps was heard.
After a while, after a series of shocking gasps, there was no longer any Greater One Sect disciples charging towards Ye Qingyu.
Half of the Greater One Sect were lying on the floor, in a half death state, clutching their face. They dizzily moaned and howled, looking for their own teeth on the floor. They had evidently suffered heavy injuries. The other half of the Greater One Sect disciples were hiding by the side. The gaze they used to regard Ye Qingyu with was like they were looking at a monster, filled with shock, rage and disbelief…
Right now, even an idiot could see that something was not right.
It seems like this little character only at the three or four Spirit springs of cultivation could not be judged using normal reason.
In the beginning, the Greater One Sect did not place too much importance on Ye Qingyu. They rushed forward one by another, but afterwards, those who were charging forward were sent flying back with an even greater speed. After their initial fury and rage, even those angry Greater One Sect disciples also began to react.
They could no longer charge forward.
This little kid was somewhat strange. He was too powerful----
The black-moled young man grabbed at Ye Qingyu's wrists, and fiercely squeezed.
At that instant, he could already imagine that he would very quickly hear the sounds of the bones in Ye Qingyu's hand snapping and breaking, hear the sounds of Ye Qingyu's tragic screams...

Chapter 480:


Not only the disciples of the Greater One Sect, even Lin Zheng, Qu Hanshan and Li Guangbi was greatly shocked.
What was happening?
The fact that Ye Qingyu's martial foundation was destroyed was something they were extremely clear about. Even Yu Junhan had acknowledged this point.
Even someone as powerful as Yu Junhan had no way of helping Ye Qingyu currently recover his yuan qi martial cultivation at this moment.
But just what was the scene that had happened just now?
There were tens of Greater One Sect disciples that had profound cultivation. Just choosing any of them and placing them anywhere in Heaven Wasteland Domain, their strength was enough to be counted as dominant in that area. For someone like Ye Qingyu, a 'cripple' that had his yuan qi martial foundation destroyed, to all be struck down by a slap after slap?
What kind of joke was this.
If everyone could be like this after destroying their yuan qi foundation, then everyone here right now had the urge to destroy the foundation themselves.
There were also some people who were able to see some intricacies within this.
Ye Qingyu had not relied on pure yuan qi power in sending the Greater One Sect disciples flying.
It was his fleshly body cultivation.
But just how strong had his fleshly body gotten, to be able to reach such a level and achieve such a result?
"You, you you... little trash, just who are you? To dare to be so arrogant and injure so many disciples of the Greater One Sect, do you know, just what you
are
doing?" A Greater One Sect disciple that seemed somewhat younger pointed at Ye Qingyu. He stuttered, unknown whether it was from rage or fear.
Those Greater One Sect disciples that had not been hit, also gathered together. They were both shocked and furious, staring fixedly at Ye Qingyu.
Ye Qingyu did not say anything.
He took out a white handkerchief from his sleeve, and began gently rubbing at his right hand.
Just now, it was this hand that had sent the Greater One Sect disciples flying.
Those Greater One Sect disciples that saw this scene were both angry and hateful.
As he slowly and neatly wiped his hands, with a casual flick, the white cloth was thrown out. Before it had even landed on the ground, it turned into powder.
Only then did Ye Qingyu lift his head and turn to face the Greater One Sect disciple who was both shocked and afraid. Calmly, "Who am I? Haha, of course I am the host."
"Host?" That young Greater One Sect disciple was taken aback.
Ye Qingyu used an emotionless and calm glance to regard him with, "I am a lifeform that is native to Heaven Wasteland Domain, I am one of the original citizens of this domain. All my ancestors have lived all their lives in this domain, my friends and family, my brothers and sisters will protect this world. My children and grandchildren will live and flourish in this world, can it be that I am not the host of this place?"
As these words were said, those experts of the military felt their breathing quickening, although Lin Zheng and the others managed to not be affected that much.
Every word of Ye Qingyu's sentence was completely what their hearts felt.
Not too long ago, when those Greater One Sect disciples used their force to pressure them, when they kept referring them to low class bumpkins, and weak ants, every one of them felt extreme humiliation and rage. But during this time, they could not think of the strongest and most powerful argument they could use to counter their insults. Even when they fought, they were defeated consecutively by their opponents…
But at this time, Ye Qingyu used such an incomparably powerful method to slap away the arrogance of these Greater One Sect members into pieces. Then he used the term 'Host', to refute his opponents. Every military leader felt the hot blood in their bodies burning, as if a flame was within it.
The eyes they looked at Ye Qingyu with was filled with pride as well as an undisguised respect.
This was a respect that came from their hearts, from their bones, a respect that was enough to make them serve to death for him.
Even Lin Zheng could not help but be slightly dumbfounded. He could not help but sigh in admiration towards Ye Qingyu in his heart.
Lin Zheng was the most exceptional genius that had arisen in these past fifty years from Snow Empire. When he faced Ye Qingyu displaying his talent, he could not help but admit from his own heart that ever since Ye Qingyu had begun to rise, the era that belonged to he, the Right Minister, had begun to fade bit by bit.
The new wave would submerge the old wave.
"Host? Haha, this is really laughable. You overestimate yourself, absolutely ridiculous," a Greater One Sect disciple said with shock and rage.
The Greater One Sect disciple that seemed a little older also laughed out of extreme fury.
"Hahaha, host? This is the greatest joke I have ever heard... your domain, it is so pitifully weak. It has not even completely formed its own laws, and has no way of withstanding the power of the Heaven Ascension stage... you are only some low class pitiful worms that are living in the gutter. In the Vast Thousand Worlds, do you know that there are classifications amongst domains? There are nine classes for a domain, but your domain can't even withstand the power of the Heaven Ascension stage. Pitiful. Haha, you know nothing, yet you call yourself the hosts of this world?"
Ye Qingyu frowned.
In the Vast Thousand Worlds, to think there were classifications?
Nine classes?
He had never had any interaction with such information.
But from the face of it, it was sharp and naked, the bare truth. Through the tone of these words, there was a faint scent of blood in it.
Once there was classification, there would be those who were higher and lower.
Once there were upper and lower decided, there must be who were ruled and the rulers.
Once there were rulers, there would be people who were ruled, people who were killed and people who were completely suppressed.
It seemed that this so called Vast Thousand Worlds was really like what people had previously worried about. All the domains were not really as peaceful. Killing and invasion, domains fighting against each other, was the eternal question.
Seeing that Ye Qingyu did not speak, they thought that he had been scared. Seeing this, the older Greater One Sect regained his spirit.
"Haha, little kid, now that you know our background, are you afraid? " He began to laugh, his head lifting up. In his eyes, there was
arrogance
once again. "Why are you not saying anything? You know you have nothing to refute me with right?"
Ye Qingyu smiled, nodding his head. He accepted without any evasions, "I really can't refute this."
"Haha, since you cannot put forward any argument, and can't refute my words, then just stop resisting. Perhaps our Greater One Sect will spare your life..." a Greater One Sect disciple sneered as he said arrogantly.
“Can't put forth any argument?" Ye Qingyu calmly uttered, "Who said that? The reason I don't refute it is just because I'm too lazy to do so. The guest trying to dominate the host, and wants to become the host themselves... since you don't listen to reason, then I'll change the method in how I discuss things with you."
As he said this, Ye Qingyu brandished his fists.
Then he took step by step towards the Greater One Sect disciples that were still forcibly standing.
Like so, the complexions of those Greater One Sect disciples that had their heads lifted up high changed exaggeratingly.
"You you you... what are you doing..." there was a Greater One Sect disciple that stuttered as he pointed at Ye Qingyu, retreating step by step. His face was filled with fear. The previous scene where Ye Qingyu had slapped away his senior disciples like rotting wood was still filling him with apprehension.
Ye Qingyu had a very gentle and warm smile, "What am I doing? I'm only changing the method in which I reason with you."
"Don't go too far." The Greater One Sect disciple that was younger suddenly had a sinister face, "You are a body cultivator isn't that right? It really is rare for a body to be cultivated to such an extent. But if you really want to solely rely on body cultivation to suppress the yuan qi martial path, you really are dreaming."
As he said this, his palm moved.
A miniature blade that was glimmering with golden light began floating above his palm, swirling and rotating. With a flick, it suddenly enlarged and grew in size. It ultimately transformed into a golden blade that was one or so meters long, held in his hands.
From the formations flickering on the golden blade, and the colour it emitted, there was an incomparably sharp aura that was spread about. The golden qi around it surged, and from it's appearance alone, it was definitely not something common. It was at least a martial weapon at the Treasured tool class.
"Haha, so what if you are at the peak of body refinement? If you are cut by my [Golden Moon Blade] that can slice apart divine steel like mud, your bones and flesh will still be hacked apart." With the blade in his hand, his aura exploded.
These words were used to remind the other Greater One Sect disciples.
The other Greater One Sect disciples' eyes brightened.
That's right, the martial path of body cultivation in the long history of time had gradually become a side branch. There were many geniuses that had abandoned it, and it had soon fallen into disuse, the main reason was that because there was a fatal weakness of using the power of one's body.
The strength of a fleshly body ultimately had no way of contesting against divine weapons.
Even if you cultivated to the very pinnacle of one's body, even if you could crush mountains and break the earth with a casual swipe, but you ultimately could not soar through the heavens. It could not contend directly against weapons, but the process of cultivating in it was extremely painful.
Ye Qingyu's fleshly body was powerful, but in the end he was just a body cultivator.
Even if the fleshly body was even stronger, could it contend against a Treasure tool?
In that moment in time, all the Greater One Sect disciples all summoned their weapons.
It was not a wonder they were disciples from a sect in a mature domain. All the weapons in their hands were rarely seen divinely sharp weapons, with the majority of them weapons at the Treasured tool class. There were even one or two Dao class weapons, emanating powerful fluctuations. In an instant, there was a killing aura completely filling the tent.
"Hahaha, little kid, you are dead for sure!"
"Your fist is very hard isn't that right? Let's see if it can be harder that my apocalyptic hammers."“
"I was nearly bluffed by this little trash... lets use weapons to greet him... these people of such a low class domain should never have seen such treasures before."
All the Greater One Sect disciples began laughing viciously.
"Really? Then let's try."
Ye Qingyu's complexion was normal, his fist striking out.
"Looking to die... Void Breaking Slash!"
The young Greater One Sect disciple shouted furiously, his golden blade sticking out, a battle technique exploding.
The golden formations on the gold blade fluctuated, and the air was like butter as it split into two parts with a whoosh. There was a golden divine light flickering on the edge of the blade. A terrifying aura gathered, causing one not to dare to regard it directly. The blade will was so strong that it seemed like the entire world would be split into two by it.
Ye Qingyu's complexion still did not change. Using the power of his bare fist, he struck directly against that divine edge.
In the time of a spark, the blade had already struck the fist.
Ding!
There was a strange sound like metal and stone hitting each other.
Then there was the noise of fracturing and cracking ---
Not only the disciples of the Greater One Sect, even Lin Zheng, Qu Hanshan and Li Guangbi was greatly shocked.
What was happening?
The fact that Ye Qingyu's martial foundation was destroyed was something they were extremely clear about. Even Yu Junhan had acknowledged this point.
Even someone as powerful as Yu Junhan had no way of helping Ye Qingyu currently recover his yuan qi martial cultivation at this moment.
But just what was the scene that had happened just now?
There were tens of Greater One Sect disciples that had profound cultivation. Just choosing any of them and placing them anywhere in Heaven Wasteland Domain, their strength was enough to be counted as dominant in that area.
