Chapter 1281:


Chapter 1295, Earth-shaking wealth
Divine General Jue's and Divine General Zhi's expression changed.
They had awakened after the end of the half-reincarnation and regained the memory of the past. In their long endless lives, it was unknown how many memories were engraved in their mind, and how many unforgettable moments there were. Their fourteen years spent with Ye Qingyu may seem brief, like a speck in a vast ocean, when compared to their millions of years of life, especially since the present Ye Qingyu was, in a way, their superior. Thus, from the beginning, they had very carefully tried to cover up those fourteen years of emotions.
But Ye Qingyu's sincerity had emotionally moved them.
If they seriously thought about it, in their long endless life, Ye Qingyu was their only ‘son’, but also the only one who had made them feel familial love. It would be a lie to say that they had completely ignored this feeling because of the awakening of their memory.
“Please get up.” Divine General Zhi supported him up at once.
“Little Yu...” Divine General Jue's eyes also reddened.
Ye Qingyu insisted on bowing respectfully on the ground three times before he got up. “No matter what, in my heart, you will always be my parents.” From the dialogue just now, Ye Qingyu had completely straighten out his thinking. Whether or not these two were related to him by blood they would always be his parents.
The atmosphere immediately became much warmer.
Ye Qingyu deliberately no longer questioned further about those secrets. Instead, he talked about his childhood, and the many interesting stories that only the three of them know about. Many feelings welled up within the two Divine Generals, and under Ye Qingyu's insistence, they also no longer addressed Ye Qingyu as Lord, but directly called him Little Yu.
For a moment, Ye Qingyu had an illusion that time was turned back to the period of his early childhood, when he was living carefree and worryfree with his parents. Those years were simple, beautiful, and unforgettable. How many times had he dreamt of his childhood before, but now, everything was so real, so beautiful, that it made him tremble.
After a long while, all three gradually calmed down.
“Father, why are you here? If I'm not mistaken, this palace should be the place where the Ye clan's wealth is stored,” Ye Qingyu asked.
Divine General Zhi nodded with a smile, “Indeed, this is a palace of wealth that countless generations of the Ye clan had spent years to build. Ye Chongsheng established the Ye clan and began to gather wealth, hunt for treasures, and plundered all over the world. After he disappeared, the desire and pursuit of this wealth had never faded from the bloodline of the Ye clan. Every generation continued to gather riches of the world. The wealth that is unimaginable to ordinary people is stored in this imperial palace. This imperial palace is constructed by the remarkable Ye Chongsheng back then. Several top figures and major forces have also discovered this place and attempted to plunder, thereby wounding the Ye clan several times. However, in the end nobody managed to break through the imperial palace. The wealth and treasures accumulated in the imperial palace can be said to be unrivalled and unimaginable.”
Divine General Jue added, “This is the tenth palace hall, the control center of the entire Ye clan's imperial palace. In addition to the treasures contained in the imperial palace ahead, there are another eighty-nine imperial palaces, which store even more astonishing treasures. Not only are there refining resources and divine materials, but also the inheritance of countless ancient forces, including the martial arts of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, as well as the cultivation mantra of major sects of past generations. There are even all kinds of Emperor weapons. This imperial palace of the Ye clan is the world's largest treasure trove.”
Ye Qingyu couldn't help gasping with astonishment when he heard this.
There are eighty-nine imperial palaces behind this, which house even more astonishing treasures?
The wealth and treasures stored in the nine treasure troves he saw along the way could already make him speechless. Unexpectedly, the previous nine palaces were only one strand of hair of the oxen. This was simply crazy. Even if Ye Qingyu's cultivation base had reached a world-shaking level, and it was difficult for external objects to make his mind fluctuate anymore, his heart was still palpitating uncontrollably when he heard this.
This was the greatest wealth that an Emperor clan had accumulated over millions of years.
That Ye Chongsheng was indeed a terrifying person to create such a powerful family and treasure trove.
“Since the Ye clan possesses such wealth, then as long as they want to dominate the world, then it should be very easy to do so. In the entire world, there is most likely no other people, domain, sect, or force who could be compared to the Ye Clan. Even the foundation of the Domain Alliance is not as deep. Also the camp that the Sky Emperor has been secretly operating in the Dark Realm also does not possess such huge wealth.” Lowering his head, Ye Qingyu pondered for a moment, and finally couldn't help asking, “Since they have such capital and strength, why did the Ye clan not do so, and instead their strength greatly declined?”
Ye Qingyu told them about what happened in Ren Puyang's funeral hall in the Domain Alliance and how he killed Ye Chongsheng.
Divine General Jue smiled, “There is something Little Yu doesn't know. When Ye Chongsheng established this world-shaking arsenal, he also set up quite a lot of restriction barriers. The rare treasures he plundered from all across the world were placed in a specific imperial palace. There are strange formations all over these imperial palaces. Basically people were only allowed to enter and not allowed to leave. The head of future generations of the Ye clan also couldn’t enter many of these imperial palaces. This is a very strange cycle. The Ye clan had exhausted the whole family's efforts, like ants collecting food, to store the world's most precious and valuable things in this arsenal, but the share that they could utilize was very little. The power of the Ye clan gradually declined, and later generations had also suffered several severe blows. Although they had withstood every time, there was still inevitable damage done.
Ye Qingyu nodded. So it was like this.
In this way, it seems that Ye Chongsheng’s original intention to establish this arsenal was a bit strange.
Could it be that Ye Chongsheng had some sort of psychological problems?
He was like a compulsive hoarder, constantly plundering, searching and storing these supreme riches, but did not convert their value into practical benefits that could be used by the Ye clan. This approach was a waste of resources. Adding to this, he also had not considered his descendants.
“Hundreds of years ago, Lord Ye learned about the Ye clan's affairs, and for some reason he went against the opinion of the masses and decided to personally attack the Ye Clan. He broke through the Ye clan’s Emperor's palace very easily, and the Ye family almost lost their greatest support overnight. In the end, a large number of descendants of the Ye clan died in the battle, while others surrendered and were then expelled. The Ye clan's imperial palace changed its master for the first time in history since it was built.”
Ye Qingyu opened his mouth.
“The... the power of this peerless God of War had reached such a level?” He had repeatedly overestimated the cultivation base of the peerless God of War, but had no idea that he was actually this powerful.
He had heard that neither side won in the battle between the Sky Emperor and the peerless God of War, but didn’t think that the War God could break into the Ye Clan’s palace that the Sky Emperor had never managed to do so in these millions of years. Moreover, Divine General Zhi used the word ‘easily’, which meant that it did not require the peerless War God much effort to capture this imperial palace.
“It was not because of strength, but Lord Ye seemed to have known the method of opening the imperial palace. Thus even if the people of the Ye family rose up to resist by operated the formations in the palace that could kill an Emperor expert, it was still no use.” Divine General Jue said strangely, “The battle that day, I was also at Lord Ye’s side. Along the way, no matter what mechanism or formation it was, he was able to break through it effortlessly. The Ye clan wanted to use the killing formations in the palace to obstruct the enemy like they have in the past. Who would have thought that they were utterly defeated, and finally only a small part of the Ye clan obtained some treasures from the imperial palace and left with the permission of Lord Ye.”
Divine General Zhi also nodded, “Among the people who left, there was also the head of the Ye clan, Ye Chongsheng. Since then, the Ye clan began to deteriorate. There was no longer an opportunity to turn over. They call themselves the Ye clan, but still hated Lord Ye to the bone. Unfortunately, there was no way they can compete with Lord Ye. In the end, the Ye clan left the Vast Thousand Domains and went to the Dark Realm, and later relied on help from the Sky Emperor.”
“Relied on help from the Sky Emperor?” Ye Qingyu exclaimed, not expecting such a thing to have happened.
Then, the Sky Emperor also knows about the existence of the Ye clan's imperial palace. Those earth-shaking treasures and riches must have great attractive force to the Sky Emperor who had been operating the camp.
“Yes, however, things did not develop in the worst direction. The Ye Chongsheng of later generation also knew what the Ye clan's imperial palace means for his clan. Thus, although he relied on help from the Sky Emperor and revealed some information, he did not tell the Sky Emperor the real value of the imperial palace. He hoped to use the hand of the Sky Emperor to recapture the imperial palace. This was of course a delusion. The Sky Emperor was conceited, and although he accepted the Ye clan, he never really treated them sincerely. In the end, Ye Chongsheng was unable to fulfill his wish and died in depression. After his death, the clan members’ understanding of the imperial palace was even more one-sided. After a hundred years, the Ye clan was no different to ordinary imperial families. The Ye Chongsheng you killed in the funeral hall should be the last descendant of the Ye clan. However, his strength was not enough, and was short-sighted. He betrayed the Sky Emperor, and escaped from the Dark Realm. Although he was called Ye Chongsheng, he really does not live up to this name.”
Hearing this, Ye Qingyu was able to connect some of the things in his memory.
The guy who calls himself Ye Chongsehng indeed escaped from the Dark Realm. Moreover, the armoured guards, housekeeper and other people at his side also possessed many treasures. After he was killed, a large amount of pseudo-emperor weapons and treasures were found on him. Presumably, this was some of the resources that the original Ye clan was permitted to take away when they were forced to leave the imperial palace. Compared with the real treasures in the imperial palace, those could only be considered as defective goods.
“And the reason we appeared in this imperial palace is because after you moved the tomb for us, we were able to leave Deer City with the help of the water channel, and returned to the imperial palace in accordance with the instructions of Lord Ye, waiting for the arrival of you, Little Yu,” Divine General Jue explained.
Divine General Zhi also nodded. “Lord Ye had instructed that, after your arrival, the earth-shaking wealth inside the imperial palace all belong to you. From now on, you are the master here. All the riches and treasures here, you can withdraw at will.”

========================================

Chapter 1282:


Chapter 1296, A born schemer
Give it all to me?
Ye Qingyu's heart jumped into his throat.
How generous?
It should be said that this was not an ordinary treasure. The amount was enough to make the whole world go crazy. The fact that the God of War had told Divine General Jue and Divine General Zhi to stand guard here already emphasized the importance he sees in this treasure. Otherwise, he would not have actively attacked the Ye clan to seize the imperial palace. However, he wanted to give all this to Ye Qingyu. It was evident that this was well planned out in advance. In other words, the God of War had prepared this generous gift for Ye Qingyu long ago.
Perhaps such a plan was decided even before he was born.
Could it be that when the God of War helped the Snow clan, established the Snow Empire, and even the marriage with the Princess Yu Junhan were also planned? Otherwise, how could he have known that he would have a son and prepared such a tremendous gift beforehand?
“Lord Ye had arranged everything. Gao Diping and Wen Wan were also ordered to assist you,,” Divine General Zhi stated. “It is clear that Lord Ye sees you as his successor. Everything he had done was for you.”
Ye Qingyu nodded.
He could also see this.
The reason the peerless God of War had painstakingly arranged all this was to help him grow and mature. And now thinking carefully, perhaps even the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and the ancient bronze book [Fiendgod Titled Chart] were prepared by the God of War and delivered to his hands through different ways and seemingly coincidental opportunities.
In the eyes of Wen Wan and the other Divine Generals, the peerless God of War was the son of destiny who they truly needed to assist, and the reason why they were so supportive of Ye Qingyu should also be because of the peerless God of War. However, they did not think that by wasting such resources and efforts on him might weaken the peerless God of War's luck and opportunity. If this happens, then will it subsequently affect the task that the Divine Light Emperor had entrusted them?
Ye Qingyu uttered this question.
“This is also a problem we were worried about, but Lord Ye insisted so we had no choice but to comply. However, Little Ye, your performance has puzzled us greatly because your talent and strength are no less inferior than that of Lord Ye. Even the growth rate of your strength has surpassed that of his. Now we really can't tell which one is the real son of destiny,” Divine General Jue explained.
In fact, this questioned also puzzled Ye Qingyu.
He was originally very certain that he is the protagonist of this era. This was not only a kind of self-confidence, but instead was made on the basis of his strength. In the present age there was no longer anybody who could match up to him in strength. The Sky Emperor and other existences were also people of the past. But after listening to what the two Divine Generals said, he began to have a real understanding of the peerless God of War.
Seriously speaking, without the peerless God of War paving the road for him, removed a lot of hidden dangers and obstacles, and even severely wounded the Sky Emperor, making his strength fall again, Ye Qingyu would not have risen so easily.
Is he the hero of this world? Or is it the peerless God of War?
Ye Qingyu no longer had that absolute self-confidence.
Following this, Ye Qingyu was in no hurry to explore the other eighty-nine imperial palaces or find out what kind of amazing treasures were stored there, instead he talked about something else with the two Divine Generals——He wanted to clear all the doubts and confusion in his mind.
The two Divine Generals had gone through numerous reincarnations, almost been through the entire history of the world, and can certainly help Ye Qingyu solve a lot of mysteries.
In addition to questions about the peerless God of War, Ye Qingyu was more concerned about another matter.
“Who was it that created the Dark Realm?” Ye Qingyu asked.
Through some of his previous experiences, he vaguely felt that the existence of the Dark Realm was definitely a good thing. Unfortunately the ruler of the Dark Realm was the Guardian camp, which had always been under the control of the Sky Emperor. This was somewhat contradictory.
“This... according to our investigation, it is the doing of Ye Chongsheng.”
“Ye Chongsheng?” Ye Qingyu was incomparably surprised by the answer.
He originally thought that it was the Divine Light Emperor or the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors who established the Dark Realm. He didn't expect... it to be that strange person.
What kind of cultivation base was required to establish the Dark Realm, which is made up of the wrecklands of different time and space civilizations?
At least Ye Qingyu was certain that he absolutely couldn't do it with his current strength.
“At that time, we were in reincarnation after deciding that Ye Chongsheng had died, and the memory of the previous generation had been completely awakened. And it was only after we had awakened our memories that we learned of the matter of the creation of the Dark Realm, which shocked us completely. Ye Chongsheng is the most mysterious and uncontrollable one among all the candidates we chose to assist. At that time we’re not sure of his original intention of creating the Dark Realm, but were still astonished by his ability. It was a very long project. He cultivated a lot of geniuses to help him, including influential figures and Martial Emperors. In the end, he really was able to accomplish this task.”
“Whatever Ye Chongsheng did often surprises everyone. It wasn't bad during the early stage, but later on his ideas and way of thinking were unpredictable. Even if we were the ones who understand him the most, we were still unable to read his thoughts. Moreover, in that long period of disappearance that made us lose confidence, he had reemerged several times, which were precisely during the time we entered reincarnation. Therefore we couldn't grasp his movements right away. And by the time our memory of the new generation had awakened, he had already suddenly vanished again, as if to deliberately avoid us.”
The two Divine Generals wore a strange expression when they talked about Ye Chongsheng.
It was obvious that, even to this day, they couldn't understand the behaviour of Ye Chongsheng or see through this person.
“In that case, why did the Dark Realm fall into the hands of the Sky Emperor?”
“The Sky Emperor is after all an ambitious and ruthless person. His methods are earth-shaking, and perhaps he saw the value of the Dark Realm, so he did not obstruct Ye Chongsheng from building the Dark Realm. However, once the Dark Realm was fully established, he decisively made a move and activated the arrangements that have long been laid out in secret. As a result, some of the people who Ye Chongsheng had heavily relied on and trusted chose betrayal in the end. During the great war, Ye Chongsheng was utterly defeated, and the Dark Realm that he had put his blood, sweat and tears in to create fell into the palm of the Sky Emperor.”
“That happened?” Ye Qingyu was surprised again.
He certainly knew about the betrayal.
In the Dark Realm, Marquis Tingtao Lin Xuan had seen the scene that showed the betrayal of that battle back then. Ye Qingyu also knew about this matter, but, for a long period of time, Ye Qingyu, from all aspects of information, had always thought that the person who was betrayed was the Divine Light Emperor. Who would have thought that...
Who would have thought that the protagonist was actually Ye Chongsheng.
“Moreover, Ye Chongsheng disappeared completely after the defeat in that battle of betrayal,” Divine General Jue stated.
“Disappeared again?” Ye Qingyu gasped.
“Yes, he disappeared again.” Divine General Zhi's expression grew serious. “However, this time, he truly disappeared, and since then he has not showed up in this world again. Later on, Lord Ye came to this world, which also suggests that Ye Chongsheng has most likely fallen in that great battle. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for Lord Ye to receive the destiny of heaven and earth and soar to the sky.”
Divine General Jue then said firmly, “In the next several lives, we made numerous investigations and did many verifications to confirm that he has indeed fallen and is no longer in this world.”
This...
Ye Qingyu couldn't help sighing when he heard this.
The Ye Chongsheng he understood from the two Divine Generals was a rather odd person, but was absolutely still a person of peerless talent. Even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors couldn’t be compared to him. However, in the end, he had fallen from the scheme of the Sky Emperor. This Sky Emperor really is the bane of heroes. He first schemed against the Divine Light Emperor, and then schemed against Ye Chongsheng. He was simply a born schemer.
“After the fall of Ye Chongsheng, the forces loyal to him were exiled by the Sky Emperor, relegated to Sinners, and had to guard the border against Invaders forever. Those who betrayed Ye Chongsheng and chose to stand on Sky Emperor's camp formed the current Guardian camp.”
Ye Qingyu couldn't help frowning, “Why did the Sky Emperor not directly eliminate the forces of Ye Chongsheng?”
“Of course, Ye Chongsheng had some ways of escape. He did not die on the spot, but had some follow-up tricks that even the Sky Emperor couldn’t break.”
Here, all the great questions that Ye Qingyu had in mind have almost all been asked.
Then he asked one of the questions that he most wanted an answer to——
“Where is War God Ye now? Do you really not know?”
Ye Qingyu looked at the two Divine Generals hopefully.
When he sees the peerless God of War, the mystery of his life will be completely cleared, the last bit of puzzlement he has will be solved, and the last contradiction in the logic of the two Divine Generals will also be clarified.
However, both Divine Generals shook their heads.
“We haven't seen Lord Ye since our last half-reincarnation.”
“He disappeared without a trace, and there is no way to reach him.” Divine General Jue shook his head, saying, “And, according to our inferences, especially since Little Yu can rise so smoothly and clearly occupies the world's destiny, it is quite possible that Lord Ye, he... is not in this world anymore.”

Give it all to me?
Ye Qingyu's heart jumped into his throat.
How generous?

Even the growth rate of your strength has surpassed that of his. Now we really can't tell which one is the real son of destiny,” Divine General Jue explained.
In fact, this questioned also puzzled Ye Qingyu.
He was originally very certain that he is the protagonist of this era. This was not only a kind of self-confidence, but instead was made on the basis of his strength. In the present age there was no longer anybody who could match up to him in strength. The Sky Emperor and other existences were also people of the past. But after listening to what the two Divine Generals said, he began to have a real understanding of the peerless God of War.
Seriously speaking, without the peerless God of War paving the road for him, removed a lot of hidden dangers and obstacles, and even severely wounded the Sky Emperor, making his strength fall again, Ye Qingyu would not have risen so easily.
Is he the hero of this world? Or is it the peerless God of War?
Ye Qingyu no longer had that absolute self-confidence.
Following this, Ye Qingyu was in no hurry to explore the other eighty-nine imperial palaces or find out what kind of amazing treasures were stored there, instead he talked about something else with the two Divine Generals——He wanted to clear all the doubts and confusion in his mind.
The two Divine Generals had gone through numerous reincarnations, almost been through the entire history of the world, and can certainly help Ye Qingyu solve a lot of mysteries.
In addition to questions about the peerless God of War, Ye Qingyu was more concerned about another matter.
“Who was it that created the Dark Realm?” Ye Qingyu asked.
Through some of his previous experiences, he vaguely felt that the existence of the Dark Realm was definitely a good thing. Unfortunately the ruler of the Dark Realm was the Guardian camp, which had always been under the control of the Sky Emperor. This was somewhat contradictory.
“This... according to our investigation, it is the doing of Ye Chongsheng.”
“Ye Chongsheng?” Ye Qingyu was incomparably surprised by the answer.
He originally thought that it was the Divine Light Emperor or the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors who established the Dark Realm. He didn't expect... it to be that strange person.
What kind of cultivation base was required to establish the Dark Realm, which is made up of the wrecklands of different time and space civilizations?
At least Ye Qingyu was certain that he absolutely couldn't do it with his current strength.
“At that time, we were in reincarnation after deciding that Ye Chongsheng had died, and the memory of the previous generation had been completely awakened. And it was only after we had awakened our memories that we learned of the matter of the creation of the Dark Realm, which shocked us completely. Ye Chongsheng is the most mysterious and uncontrollable one among all the candidates we chose to assist. At that time we’re not sure of his original intention of creating the Dark Realm, but were still astonished by his ability. It was a very long project. He cultivated a lot of geniuses to help him, including influential figures and Martial Emperors. In the end, he really was able to accomplish this task.”
“Whatever Ye Chongsheng did often surprises everyone. It wasn't bad during the early stage, but later on his ideas and way of thinking were unpredictable. Even if we were the ones who understand him the most, we were still unable to read his thoughts. Moreover, in that long period of disappearance that made us lose confidence, he had reemerged several times, which were precisely during the time we entered reincarnation. Therefore we couldn't grasp his movements right away. And by the time our memory of the new generation had awakened, he had already suddenly vanished again, as if to deliberately avoid us.”
The two Divine Generals wore a strange expression when they talked about Ye Chongsheng.
It was obvious that, even to this day, they couldn't understand the behaviour of Ye Chongsheng or see through this person.
“In that case, why did the Dark Realm fall into the hands of the Sky Emperor?”
“The Sky Emperor is after all an ambitious and ruthless person. His methods are earth-shaking, and perhaps he saw the value of the Dark Realm, so he did not obstruct Ye Chongsheng from building the Dark Realm. However, once the Dark Realm was fully established, he decisively made a move and activated the arrangements that have long been laid out in secret. As a result, some of the people who Ye Chongsheng had heavily relied on and trusted chose betrayal in the end. During the great war, Ye Chongsheng was utterly defeated, and the Dark Realm that he had put his blood, sweat and tears in to create fell into the palm of the Sky Emperor.”
“That happened?” Ye Qingyu was surprised again.
He certainly knew about the betrayal.
In the Dark Realm, Marquis Tingtao Lin Xuan had seen the scene that showed the betrayal of that battle back then. Ye Qingyu also knew about this matter, but, for a long period of time, Ye Qingyu, from all aspects of information, had always thought that the person who was betrayed was the Divine Light Emperor. Who would have thought that...
Who would have thought that the protagonist was actually Ye Chongsheng.
“Moreover, Ye Chongsheng disappeared completely after the defeat in that battle of betrayal,” Divine General Jue stated.
“Disappeared again?” Ye Qingyu gasped.
“Yes, he disappeared again.” Divine General Zhi's expression grew serious. “However, this time, he truly disappeared, and since then he has not showed up in this world again. Later on, Lord Ye came to this world, which also suggests that Ye Chongsheng has most likely fallen in that great battle. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for Lord Ye to receive the destiny of heaven and earth and soar to the sky.”
Divine General Jue then said firmly, “In the next several lives, we made numerous investigations and did many verifications to confirm that he has indeed fallen and is no longer in this world.”
This...
Ye Qingyu couldn't help sighing when he heard this.
The Ye Chongsheng he understood from the two Divine Generals was a rather odd person, but was absolutely still a person of peerless talent. Even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors couldn’t be compared to him. However, in the end, he had fallen from the scheme of the Sky Emperor. This Sky Emperor really is the bane of heroes. He first schemed against the Divine Light Emperor, and then schemed against Ye Chongsheng. He was simply a born schemer.
“After the fall of Ye Chongsheng, the forces loyal to him were exiled by the Sky Emperor, relegated to Sinners, and had to guard the border against Invaders forever. Those who betrayed Ye Chongsheng and chose to stand on Sky Emperor's camp formed the current Guardian camp.”
Ye Qingyu couldn't help frowning, “Why did the Sky Emperor not directly eliminate the forces of Ye Chongsheng?”
“Of course, Ye Chongsheng had some ways of escape. He did not die on the spot, but had some follow-up tricks that even the Sky Emperor couldn’t break.”
Here, all the great questions that Ye Qingyu had in mind have almost all been asked.
Then he asked one of the questions that he most wanted an answer to——
“Where is War God Ye now? Do you really not know?”
Ye Qingyu looked at the two Divine Generals hopefully.
When he sees the peerless God of War, the mystery of his life will be completely cleared, the last bit of puzzlement he has will be solved, and the last contradiction in the logic of the two Divine Generals will also be clarified.
However, both Divine Generals shook their heads.
“We haven't seen Lord Ye since our last half-reincarnation.”
“He disappeared without a trace, and there is no way to reach him.” Divine General Jue shook his head, saying, “And, according to our inferences, especially since Little Yu can rise so smoothly and clearly occupies the world's destiny, it is quite possible that Lord Ye, he... is not in this world anymore.”

========================================

Chapter 1283:


Chapter 1297, Dust settled

Ye Qingyu was speechless when he heard this answer.

This was the contradiction in logic that he had thought of before.

If the peerless God of War were the son of destiny of this era and world, then he would not have had the cultivation base that he has presently because the universe's destiny and luck cannot be divided. Unless, it was a good and an evil star like back then, where both the God Emperor of Light and the Sky Emperor existed. However, from the way the God of War acts he was surely not evil and Ye Qingyu also firmly believed that he is good.

There was only one explanation for this: the peerless God of War really has fallen and vanished.

Therefore, he was able to reoccupy the destiny of the world and grew stronger so smoothly.

The questions that Ye Qingyu could think of had basically all been asked and answered.

Many of the mysteries that have troubled him for a long period of time had been solved, and some things that can't be solved, after this conversation, can also be figured out. However, there were subsequently more questions and mysteries.

Ye Qingyu firmly believed that many things were absolutely not as simple as they appeared to be on the surface.

But he also has to admit that perhaps, following the disappearance of some people there were some mysteries that may never be solved.

Next, the trio talked about something else.

When they mentioned Lang Zhong and Lang Yong, the two Divine Generals also sighed.

In the countless reincarnation cycles before this life, they, who had to shoulder the mission, were basically constantly on the move in every life. They were rarely able to leisurely truly experience the secular world like an ordinary martial artist. When they adopted Long Zhong and Long Yong, it was their first time taking in children in their long lives thus it was inevitable for them to be so attached.

“Father and mother, are you going to go out or continue to stay here?” Ye Qingyu asked: “Why don't you return to Light City with Little Yu. The Snow Empire has undergone great changes.”

Divine General Jue and Divine General Zhi exchanged a glance.

Divine General Zhi responded. “Of course it will be great to return to the real world, but we must stay here and guard the imperial palace. If we leave, the imperial palace will be left unguarded, and it will be very dangerous if anything were to happen. If this earth-shaking wealth falls into the hands of others, there is bound to be endless disasters.”

Ye Qingyu gave a slight smile and said: “Don't worry about this, I will first take a look at the formations in the imperial palaces.”

Since the peerless God of War had given him this generous gift, then he has no reason to decline. This amazing wealth, for Ye Qingyu, who plans to fight against the civilization reincarnation calamity, will undoubtedly be of great help. Moreover, Ye Qingyu even more urgently needs this wealth after learning about the existence of the Demon God of time and space.



Next, under the guidance of the two Divine Generals, Ye Qingyu began to understand the central core formations of the Ye clan's imperial palace.



These formations were originally very complicated and profound, and differed entirely from many of the present age formations. Instead they belong to the product of the ancient times. However, this was not a problem for Ye Qingyu because he was very familiar with the text and formations of the God and Demon era and had a deep mastery of the 108 ancient symbols of the Cloud top cauldron. Thus he could easily control the core formations of the Ye clan's imperial palace.



“The formations in this imperial palace are vaguely similar to the 108 ancient symbols, and seem to be of the same style of rune formations.” Ye Qingyu found some clues.



It took him about half a day to completely control and understand all the formations in the entire Ye clan's imperial palace.



“It is indeed mysterious, like the means of an immortal demon.”



Ye Qingyu's divine sense sank into the formations, immediately taking control of everything within the palace. In each of the palaces there were killing Emperor formations, Emperor concealment formations and Emperor protection formations,  the three great emperor formations, as defense. Even if a martial Emperor were to come, it would be still be difficult to notice the existence of the imperial palace. And even if found, it will be difficult for them to break through. Once an Emperor killing formation is triggered they will most likely be buried in this palace. Even if a top enemy manages to break through one imperial palace, the 99 imperial palace can at the same time join forces to strike back. Even Ye Qingyu might not be able to withstand against such force.



This also explains why the Ye clan can rely on these imperial palaces to last for such a long period of time, from the era of Ye Chongsheng to the present day.



If they had not encountered the peerless God of War, the Ye clan would most likely still be looking disdainfully at other forces of the world.



Through the formations, Ye Qingyu could even see Hon Kong, Yan Xingtian and Qin Wushuang anxiously waiting in the 10th imperial palace. Yan Xingtian and Hon Kong even tried to break the door of the imperial palace several times, but failed in the end——Fortunately the killing formations in the imperial palace were not activated, otherwise, these two would have been in a very difficult situation.



“Please don’t be impatient.” Ye Qingyu directly transmitted his voice through the formation. “I will soon be out.”

It was only when Hon Kong and the others realised that it was Ye Qingyu’s voice that they breathed a sigh of relief knowing that Ye Qingyu was not in any danger.

Next, Ye Qingyu, through the formation ccontrol, observed the storage space of the other 88 imperial palaces, and was still utterly shocked despite what the two Divine Generals had told him.



For example, in one imperial palace was the most complete rune formation scripture of the rune Emperor Luosu, and in another palace stored the Storm Emperor's Dao scripture and Emperor weapon [The Source of the Storm].....Basically, the inheritance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors can be found in a particular imperial palace, and were incomparably intact.



In addition to the inheritance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, there were inheritances of the Emperors of the dark age after the God Emperor of Light——which the later generations called the God and Demon era, as well as inheritance of Emperors after the disappearance of Ye Chongsheng. Within the imperial palaces were countless immortal treasures, piles of immortal materials used to cast Emperor weapons, and a variety of treasures, including refined divine weapons, as well as divine pills with medicinal properties. There were also all kinds of armour, imperial battleships, and mobile transportation formations.......



Ye Qingyu only roughly scanned across the treasure but stormy waves were still set off in his mind.



Looking at these treasures and remarkable wealth, you will imagine what kind of power and civilizations had been born and developed over the past long history.



And now they all belonged to him.



The huge problem that Ye Qingyu had to face now was how to make good use of the wealth in the Ye clan's imperial palace.

Then he quickly thought of the cosmic-level light brain Taichu.



Such a complex project will require the calculation, classification, and adjustment of the light brain, in order to create a plan that can truly maximise the wealth of the imperial palace and then strictly implement it. In this regard, Ye Qingyu had the utmost confidence in the light brain of the earth civilization, which was much more powerful than an Emperor-level expert's divine sense.

After pondering for a while, Ye Qingyu once again set up some little formations with the 108 ancient symbols in the core formation of the imperial palace before he said to the two Divine Generals: “After such modifications, even if we're not in the imperial palace, I can still control everything. Father and Mother can go out with me and will no longer have to stay here.”



……



Yan Xingtian and others were taken aback when they saw Ye Qingyu come out of the 10th imperial palace with the two Divine Generals.



They didn't expect there to be people in the Ye clan's imperial palace.

When asked about the palace, Ye Qingyu did not hesitate to speak the truth, but when it comes to the contents of the core treasure, he still slightly concealed a little information.



Qin Wushuang was very excited to hear this. “If so, then the Empire's Light City and Deer City can be rebuild and a Divine city can be built in Heaven Wasteland domain. It will become the iconic city-state of Heaven Wasteland domain. As for the rest of the wealth, if used appropriately, it can bring the strength of the entire Heaven Wasteland Empire up another level.”



Ye Qingyu nodded with a smile: “That’s correct, but at this time we still have a lot to consider. Senior Qin may wish to discuss this matter with the survivors of White Deer Academy and Deer city. If there are any requirements, you can report to the Imperial Military Department. In the future, Senior Qin will also need to take control of this newly built Deer City.”



Qin Wushuang's eyes lit up with excitement when he heard this.



Because he knew very clearly that, after reconstruction, Deer City will certainly play a vital role in the Empire. Moreover, Deer City was after all the land of the Qin clan. His father and relatives have also died here, and as a descendant of the Qin clan, he also hoped to revitalize the prestige of the Qin clan and let his clan continue to expand here.



As for the introduction of the two Divine Generals, Ye Qingyu also did not conceal anything and directly addressed them as his parents.



This came as a shock to Hon Kong and the others.



They only knew little about the life of Ye Qingyu, and had occasionally heard about the relationship between Yu Junhan and Ye Qingyu. However, they did not care too much. But now, knowing that these two people were actually Ye Qingyu's parents, they also dared not to be disrespectful and hurried over to pay respect.



After that, the group left the imperial palace.



The seal on the ground remained.



Ye Qingyu ordered people to fill up this pit, and then released the news that below are the abandoned ruins of an ancient sect and are full of hidden dangers.



The pit was quickly filled.



After that, Ye Qingyu and the others returned to the imperial capital.



Yan Xingtian followed.



Divine General Jue and Divine General Zhi met Wen Wan, Gao Diping and Wang Lijin and the Martial Artist of Shadow in the Light city. Their appearance made Wen Wan and others remember everything from the past, and completely awakened their memory.



They couldn't help feeling emotional seeing that the old comrades had gathered together once again.



Three days later, Ye Qingyu left Heaven Wasteland domain and traveled to the Domain Alliance of the Chaos Domain.

========================================

Chapter 1284:


Chapter 1298, A new crisis

After Heaven Wasteland Domain was blocked by the Sky Emperor, the Domain Alliance was also pushed into turmoil, because the people outside of Heaven Wasteland Domain were shocked to find that they couldn’t contact the domain and the Domain Gate leading to Heaven Wasteland Domain also wouldn’t open. This was an unprecedented phenomenon.

It was a core-shaking test for the living beings of Heaven Wasteland Domain that were in other domains for business, travel, and cultivation. In particular, the imperial envoys dispatched and stationed in other domains and in the Domain Alliance.

There were all sorts of statements.

Over these years, Heaven Wasteland Domain had vaguely become the world's most powerful territory, especially since the Deputy Envoy of the Human Race, Ye Qingyu, had consecutively made legendary accomplishments in several battles. Ye Qingyu had also created a very high reputation and status for the Human Race and Heaven Wasteland Domain.

However, with the gradual refinement of the laws of heaven and earth and the rising spiritual qi tide, the experts of all sides continued to break through the upper limit of the past. In the past few years, the strength of Quasi-emperor experts can be said to be close to that of Martial Emperors. A Quasi-emperor can almost suppress one side, standing at the commanding heights overlooking the whole world. The reason why Ye Qingyu was able to suppress all sides was because he had killed the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect. But now, there were constantly experts breaking through into the Quasi-emperor realm, and in a few years time, the number of Quasi-emperors had risen dramatically.

An unprecedented increase in power, of course, is accompanied by the growth of wild ambition.

Against such a backdrop, some forces, some people, and some sects, had become restless again.

The newly promoted Quasi-emperor experts were constantly trying to improve themselves in the hope of advancing further, while some seek after fame and fortune, aiming to achieve the reputation of the best in the world. And the best and fastest way to become famous, of course, was to challenge and defeat the renowned experts.

For the high and mighty Quasi-emperors, there were not many people worthy of challenging. Ye Qingyu, who was vaguely known as the strongest expert in the Vast Thousand Domains these years, was obviously a good target to challenge.

But Ye Qingyu had accumulated a lot of prestige, and although many new Quasi-emperors were tempted to challenge him, they did not dare to rashly rush to his door, and instead did some petty tricks in the dark while waiting for the right opportunity.

Some of them arrogantly let out the words in various occasions that Ye Qingyu is the past and now is the golden era of the tens of millions of Quasi-emperors, and that Ye Qingyu no longer possessed ruling power. Through various ways of provocation they hoped to ignite Ye Qingyu's anger and take the initiative to attack. Some even used this method to trigger battles between Ye Qingyu and some other Quasi-emperors, while they watch and then reap the rewards when both sides are exhausted.

However, to the disappointment of many people, no matter what kind of provocation it was, Ye Qingyu remained silent and never made any response.

In these years, the former strongest martial artist of the Vast Thousand Domains had not appeared again.

Some people thought that Ye Qingyu was saving strength to attack the Emperor realm, while some thought that flaws had emerged in Ye Qingyu's cultivation. After all, he had risen to the top too rapidly. A rapid advancement along the martial arts path could cause one’s foundation to be unstable. There were also rumours that Ye Qingyu had gone to the Dark Realm to fight with the dark creatures in order to improve himself, but may have died in the Dark Realm. The Dark Realm had always been the grave of experts of the Vast Thousand Domains. The former main envoy of the Human Race Ren Puyang also died in the Dark Realm.

Under various rumours were all sorts of ambitions and wild schemes.

Therefore, when the Domain Gate of Heaven Wasteland Domain was suddenly sealed without warning, the outside world could no longer contact Heaven Wasteland Domain, these statements and rumours also exploded and spread uncontrollably. As some people added fuel to the fire, the situation began to move in a direction unfavourable to Heaven Wasteland Domain.

In Heaven Connect City, the Great Dragon Turtle Demon, who oversaw the Heaven Wasteland Building, found that the board that Ye Qingyu personally inscribed ‘Heaven Wasteland Building’ on had unknowingly been crushed by a fist print early in the morning. At the same time, many figures appeared around the Heaven Wasteland Building. They were evidently from the sects and forces with new Quasi-emperors...

At the same time, the envoys of Heaven Wasteland Domain stationed in other major domains were also in extremely difficult situations.

Many of Heaven Wasteland Domain embassies in other domains also suffered from attacks.

In particular, an envoy of Heaven Wasteland Domain in the Water Moon Domain was intercepted and killed by an unidentified Quasi-emperor expert on the official road...

There was an invisible countercurrent aimed at Heaven Wasteland Domain surging violently.

The Great Dragon Turtle Demon felt the crisis.

He had tried countless times to contact the empire, but unfortunately the Domain Gate of Heaven Wasteland Domain couldn’t be opened, as if isolated. The emergency contact channels that Ye Qingyu left behind also failed to operate.

Everyone in the Heaven Wasteland Building was in panic.

The Great Dragon Turtle Demon tried to calm himself down.

He was already at the peak of the Great Saint realm, and was only one step away from the Quasi-emperor, but in today's situation, he still felt the great pressure.

“Heaven Wasteland Domain is captured.”

On this day, the Four Stars Sect let out these words that shocked all sides.

The figure of the Four Stars Holy Girl that had not been seen for a long while appeared in Heaven Connect City. The Four Stars Holy Girl, who was almost crippled by Ye Qingyu back then, displayed the strongest tyrannical strength. Not only was her strength restored, it had improved drastically and had already reached the Quasi-emperor realm.

“Ye Qingyu is finished, he is in the Dark Realm and had offended the wrong person. The glory that belongs to him is now in the past!”

The remaining members of the Black Moon Immortal Palace also re-emerged.

And the Patriarch of another former large sect, Tianqian Sect, also showed up in Heaven Connect City, in a restaurant a few hundred meters away from the Heaven Wasteland Building. He had also become a Quasi-emperor expert. He watched the Heaven Wasteland Building from afar, while drinking and joking with countless martial arts experts, “Haha, this small building can be the garbage storage of my Tianqian sect...”

Even the main envoy of the Human Race of the Domain Alliance, because of his former bias towards Ye Qingyu and the Heaven Wasteland Empire, also suffered from accusations and criticism. The main envoys of other domains suddenly revolted at another meeting, causing the present chief envoy of the Human Race to be stripped off the position of parliamentary elder, which was similar to having his power seized.

“The short era is coming to an end.”

“Ye Qingyu's glory is about to set with the sun.”

“Unfortunately, Ye Qingyu's strength, for the Human Race, is more like the last radiance of the setting sun. Now that last wisp of light had dissipated. The crisis and weakening of power of the Human Race is already unstoppable.”

There were such rumours everywhere across Heaven Connect City.

Suddenly, another news began to spread in Heaven Connect City. A total of sixteen Quasi-emperor forces, including the Four Stars Sect and the Tianqian Sect had announced the formation of an alliance to officially revolt against Heaven Wasteland Domain and Ye Qingyu.

“The shame of the past must be erased. If you win you are the king, if you lose you are nothing. Our Four Stars Sect wants revenge, and will absolutely not endure any longer.”

The Four Stars Holy Girl appeared outside the Heaven Wasteland Building.

Along with the masters and patriarchs of other major forces, as well as many influential people who had come to watch the lively scene.

The shops within thousands of kilometers of the Heaven Wasteland Building had quietly closed.

Many hawkers also closed up and left the trouble spot.

More importantly, some cowardly people also left Heaven Connect City.

“Tell Ye Qingyu to come out. There is no use in hiding, he can't escape either way.” The patriarch of the Tianqian Sect ordered people to spread these words out while he was drinking in that restaurant.

“There should be an end to everything, Ye Qingyu must pay for his previous tyrannical massacre,” the Four Stars Holy Girl stated.

She had been humiliated in the hands of Ye Qingyu, and if the Third Prince of the Mizar Race had not saved her perhaps she would have been dead now. But now she had paid a huge price and made a strong effort to recover, possessing even greater strength than before. She was now the present patriarch of the Four Stars Sect and planned to erase the humiliation of the past.

The situation was extremely unfavourable to Heaven Wasteland Domain.

And facing the pressure was the people in the Heaven Wasteland Building.

The envoys of other domains that could come came right away. At the same time, the allies of Heaven Wasteland Domain also came to assist. The Dragon Human Race that had reached a strategic alliance with Heaven Wasteland Domain long ago, also came to help right away. The Dragon Human Race’s Military God Xu Wuya and an army of iron armour-clad guards were stationed next to the Heaven Wasteland Building.

For the first time, some Quasi-emperor forces that had a peaceful relationship with Heaven Wasteland Domain also came to Heaven Connect City.

Yu Xiaxing's operation in the Vast Thousand Domains these years was not useless.

But overall, they were still at a disadvantage.

After all, no one knew what the situation in Heaven Wasteland Domain was, and many forces were watching from the sidelines.

……

“The Palace Lord's kindheartedness had allowed a trash like the Four Stars Holy Girl to re-emerge.” An official of the Heaven Wasteland Building was enraged.

At this time, the officials stationed in the building, regardless of their strength, had already put on armour and were ready for a fight to the death. In the face of the coming storm, the elites and faithful officials selected by the Heaven Wasteland Empire were incomparably united.

“At worst it’s only death.”

Everyone was ready to die for their country.

At this moment, words came from the Four Stars Sect once again——

“The people in the Heaven Wasteland Building listen up, if you come out to surrender now you can be spared death. Otherwise, today I will wash the Heaven Wasteland Building with blood to avenge the brothers who died for the Four Stars Sect back then.”

The person who yelled was the trusted aide of the Four Stars Holy Girl. His tone of voice was aggressive and arrogant.

They incredibly looked forward to the members of the Heaven Wasteland Building coming out to surrender, which will be a huge blow to the power of Ye Qingyu and the dignity of the Heaven Wasteland Empire.

Inside the building.

The Great Dragon Turtle Demon wore a smile on his face. The greater the pressure, the calmer his heart was. He ran his eyes across every colleague, noticing the same calmness, battle intent, and anger against the enemy. Everybody was unafraid of dying.
That's correct, the Heaven Wasteland Building may be attacked, and all the colleagues and I may die in battle, but we will never surrender
.

“Everyone, please drink this cup, do not regret being part of Heaven Wasteland Domain, even after death we are souls of Heaven Wasteland!” The Great Dragon Turtle Demon roared.

All of the officials of the Heaven Wasteland Building laughed and drank the cup of wine heroically.

Just then, suddenly, a voice sounded, “Haha, ‘do not regret being part of Heaven Wasteland Domain, even after death we are souls of Heaven Wasteland’. You are indeed worthy of being called the warriors of my Heaven Wasteland Empire. How can you drink without me?”

Everybody was taken aback.

The Great Dragon Turtle Demon's face lit up with indescribable joy, voice trembling, “Palace Lord Ye Qingyu... you... you're back?
