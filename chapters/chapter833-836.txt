Chapter 833:


Chapter 850 - Emotionally Captured
What?!
The dark holy girl?!
Fought against her and was even wounded?
As if a terrifying wave had swept across his heart, Ye Qingyu became nervous, shocked, and anxious like never before.
Could the dark holy girl of the Unmoving City of Darkness really be... Song Xiaojun?
He paused for a moment to stabilize his emotions. Having not divulged too much, he tried to make himself look calmer before he questioned, "So, you've seen that dark holy girl? Can you describe what kind of person she is?"
Actually, he already had a fairly certain answer deep down.
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden sat down slowly and recalled in detail.
Subsequently, with her eyes carrying a tinge of respect akin to that shown by a warrior toward a top-level expert, she said, "The dark holy girl? It's said that she's one of the rulers of the Unmoving City of Darkness, and only recently emerged as a dark leader. She appeared to be rather young, with a head of dazzling and flaming-red long hair, and was dressed in dark-red battle garments which were strange and mysterious, as if they were dyed using the dark blood gathered from countless dead beings. She was also wearing a mask and thus her face couldn't be seen clearly. However, her aura and eye expression revealed a maturity and cruelty beyond her years. Nobody knows where she came from, but her strength was terrifyingly immense."
It's indeed her... Song Xiaojun!
After he finished listening to the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's description, he went into a state of inner shock and agitation despite remaining unperturbed on the surface.
He could confirm without a doubt that the dark holy girl which the Celestial Phoenix Maiden was talking about was Song Xiaojun.
For an instant, the figure of a petite and delicate little girl flashed across his mind involuntarily.
It was the Song Xiaojun who, wearing an oversized robe, stood in front of everyone and protected him, and even after returning to the Unmoving City of Darkness, secretly protected him on many occasions despite having lost her memory. Ye Qingyu had never expected that the Unmoving City of Darkness would once again appear on the Road of Chaos, and that Song Xiaojun's strength would become frightening enough to be comparable to that of the Celestial Phoenix Maiden.
Generally speaking, he should be happy to hear that she had reappeared and that her strength had increased so rapidly.
However, he could not feel happy at present.
This was because, according to the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's account, the Unmoving City of Darkness and the Phoenix Race were in a state of mutual disagreement, and the differences between them were not what he could solve. More importantly, he would not wish for anything bad to happen to either the Celestial Phoenix Maiden or Song Xiaojun, especially the latter...
He turned his head back to look at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, intending to ask her some more questions concerning the dark holy girl.
Just then, without any warning, a bright pale-red splendor suddenly flickered out of nowhere in the room.
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden's expression unexpectedly changed as she peered at it.
Turning her head, she stared attentively at Ye Qingyu as if she wanted to firmly remember his appearance deep in her heart.
"Time's up. My race elder is urging me to hurry. I have to go..."
There was a sense of frustration in her tone.
Briefly stunned, Ye Qingyu near-instinctively asked, "Go where?"
However, a beam of silver light suddenly flashed past him before the Celestial Phoenix Maiden had said another word.
The next instant.
Before an astounded-looking Ye Qingyu, who still had a bag full of questions, could react, he was completely shrouded in a silver formation splendor and was teleported out of the room.
At the same time as his figure gradually disappeared into the air, two ripples subtly undulated in the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's room before two beams of light emerged from them.
One was the pretty, frosty, and yet still a tad immature Little Princess of the Black Demon Race, who was wearing a silver battle garment.
The other was the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's guardian.
"Your Highness, everything has been prepared. The elites from the [Blazing Hall] have already set off for the battlefield in advance..." The guardian elder looked at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden with anguish and reluctance flashing across his eyes. After all, as her guardian, he had followed beside her for many years and had practically watched her grow up, and thus certainly knew what her intention was for this undertaking.
She briefly acknowledged and subconsciously nodded, yet there was still an unconcern in her eyes.
Seeing this, the guardian elder sighed inwardly.
He had truly never expected that the proud and supreme jewel of his race that was this cold-as-a-never-melting-iceberg goddess, who was also the Heaven's prideling that had protected the Phoenix Race from countless foreign races which pursued it covetously, would within such a short time become enamored of a nobody from a Human Race lower domain because of a trip to the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss.
As someone who had seen it all and followed beside the Celestial Phoenix Maiden for the longest time, he naturally understood her best.
It was just that this degree of understanding was still a long way from knowing the extent to which the Celestial Phoenix Maiden could be captured emotionally.
Yes, the guardian elder was by now already clearly aware that only one word could describe the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's feelings toward Ye Qingyu, and that was - captured.
Given her character, once she was captured emotionally, it would remain that way until her death. No matter what happened, she would absolutely not turn back, and would never change the target of her affection. That was why during the moment when he saw Ye Qingyu holding hands with the Heaven Wasteland empress as they walked onto the Saint Hearing Platform, his heart felt like it was being violently seized by something, and he had an impulse to rush forward and slice apart that pair of hands.
Until this day, even he himself could not help wondering if, back then on the Fierce Beast Peak of Taowu Mountain Range, his agreement and insistence that Ye Qingyu follow the Celestial Phoenix Maiden into the Door of Life was the right decision or an absurdly erroneous one.
If not for the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss, perhaps the Celestial Phoenix Maiden would not be like this today?
Although the Phoenix Race is no doubt an ally of the
Human Race
, yet honestly speaking, how many years has it been since a member of the Phoenix Race married into the
Human Race
? It has been so many years that even I, who have lived for several thousand years and counting, can't remember clearly. Besides, how can the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, who is the pearl that would decide the destiny and future of the Phoenix Race, marry to a nobody from the Human Race?
Even if he's a supreme Heaven's prideling of the Human Race, marrying the Celestial Phoenix Maiden would be something unlikely.
Moreover, although he does enjoy a certain reputation at present and has caused quite a stir already, he's still a long, long way from the level of a supreme Heaven's prideling.
On several occasions, the guardian elder had wanted to talk sense into the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, yet when the words were at the tip of his tongue, he was unable to say anything after looking into her limpid eyes.
He sighed deep down and buried these thoughts in his heart, without thinking about anything else.
This was because he knew that there was something more important for the Celestial Phoenix Maiden to do at this time.
The situation that would soon transpire also caused him a fair amount of headache.
He fully understood the importance of the upcoming battle to the Celestial Phoenix Maiden.
Therefore, he eventually put his loving heart down and spoke firmly, "Your Highness, you must get started as soon as possible, or otherwise, our elites will be leaderless in the dark prison battlefield, and the situation will become even more disadvantageous."
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden nodded.
However, there was a complicated look in his eyes as he continued to ponder over something.
Beside him was the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race, whose reasons for appearing here were unknown. She blinked her alert large eyes as she looked all around the room, before returning her gaze on to the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, when she could not help laughing mischievously.
"Haha... Elder sister, you look... Huh? You've fallen for Ye Qingyu, right? Don't deny it. Why else would you not mind putting the Phoenix Race's battle to one side, while dragging your injured body tens of millions of Kilometers to get here, just for the sake of seeing him?
"You little kid... It was just that I'd promised him to come here for the Heaven Wasteland Domain's grading." The Celestial Phoenix Maiden's expression and tone became natural once more, yet deep down, she did not refute the Little Princess' version of things.
"Oh, looks like you've really fallen for him. Haha, a single promise can make you rush like this at such a critical moment. Seems like this promise must be very important..." Revealing an expression of sudden enlightenment, the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race hurriedly placed her hands behind her back and purposely posed as if she had arrived at a conclusion, "Elder sister, you're in love."
"What do you even know." The Celestial Phoenix Maiden gave a glare with her beautiful eyes.
Over several cooperations, the relationship between the Black Demon Abyss and the Phoenix Race had entered a honeymoon period. Furthermore, because they were of the same gender, and had been in a life-and-death situation together in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss, the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race and the Celestial Phoenix Maiden found out that their personalities were exceptionally agreeable, and thus they got along like close friends.
The Little Princess of the Black Demon Race made nothing of the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's flat denial.
She nodded thoughtfully and said, "Hee hee, don't deny it. Actually, it's normal that you would like him. Whether in terms of strength, potential, or bearing, Ye Qingyu can indeed be considered the best among the younger generation of all races. If I was born a few years earlier, I would also like him to bits."
"Little kid, you're becoming more and more nonsensical." The Celestial Phoenix Maiden took out a space bracelet and opened up a space gate in the room. "Looks like I have to get someone to send you back to the Black Demon Abyss."
While speaking, the three figures entered the space gate and disappeared on the spot.
Ye Qingyu did not know about the conversation that took place in that room after he left.
Evidently, the last-minute teleportation was not controlled by the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, who Ye Qingyu wanted to pose a few more questions to, especially regarding the Unmoving City of Darkness which was one of his sore points. If he could find out the cause of the conflict between the Phoenix Race and the Unmoving City of Darkness, perhaps he could defuse it...

========================================

Chapter 834:


Chapter 851 A Roc Inevitably Rises



"Never mind."
As he thought to this point, Ye Qingyu suddenly felt that he was deceiving himself a little. To resolve the enmity between two large races was something which even [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], or the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and Song Xiaojun themselves, might not be able to do, and given Ye Qingyu's current cultivation and status, this was akin to fantasy.

He was teleported back to Ren Puyang's room.

There was still only the latter in there.

When he saw Ye Qingyu reappear, Ren Puyang looked at him with very mischievous eyes and revealed a faint smile, "Good times don't last, you're back so soon? What a baller, child, you're the first human I've seen in several thousand years who can obtain special treatment from the Phoenix Race. Hahaha, do you now know why I kept you alone in this room? Honestly speaking, I was a little worried when I sent you over. After all, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's heart was broken when she saw you holding hands with the Heaven Wasteland empress and stepping onto the Saint Hearing Platform together... Sigh, you young people certainly don't choose the time and place for love. Don't you know, there were some among the Phoenix Race who were enraged by that. I'd thought you would at least be given a bloodied nose and a swollen face in that room, but seeing that you've come back completely intact, well, my old heart can finally return to its place."

"This doesn't sound like anything an important person like you should say." Ye Qingyu was a little speechless.

When they first met on the reception square outside Heaven Connect City, Mr. Ren Puyang's bearing was as admirable and noble as that of an otherworldly Immortal, and he possessed the charm of a sect master. Yet, this being only the second meeting, he had suddenly become similar to the likes of Old Fish, all ridiculing and teasing, transforming from a lofty sect master into a drinking buddy in an earthly tavern. The Immortal-like bearing was completely gone, leaving behind only some crude and tasteless tea and wine, and some soy sauce and vinegar.

"Don't you know, it's very tiring to constantly maintain the demeanor and seriousness of an important person," Ren Puyang said as he leaned back on his chair and grinned. "I can only do as I please when nobody's around... It was for the sake of the Human Race that I sent you there, for our situation will improve a lot if we can acquire stronger support from the Phoenix Race. What's more, the Heaven Wasteland Domain will also benefit from this association. Your ancestors had shed blood and sweat to propagate the race, haha, little child, what's sacrificing a bit of your charming male body?"

Ye Qingyu had absolutely nothing to say.

This old man certainly doesn't know how to respect himself.

"By the way, about Qin Hui and her son..." He hurriedly changed the subject to prevent this self-disrespecting old man from continuing his mockery.

But, to tell the truth, Ren Puyang's casually-ridiculing attitude made him feel warm. If Ren Puyang had been a lofty and respectful elder in his earlier estimation, then the former was currently like a long-lost friend. The distance between them had shrunk significantly, and Ye Qingyu's trust in Ren Puyang had grown in leaps and bounds.

"Oh, about the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect." A hint of anger flashed across Ren Puyang's eyes when this matter was brought up, "I already know what happened. I'd never thought that old friend of mine would already have died in the Black Demon Abyss. For sixty years, I've not left Heaven Connect City because of all the things I have to attend to. By the time I heard news about him, the object remains but the man is no longer, and I'll never see him again. What's more, it's truly shameful that I wasn't able to take good care of his descendants either... The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors rose from insignificance to attain the honor of martial emperors, and engaged in bloody battles for the sake of the Human Race's living space in the Vast Thousand Domains. It's a pity that today's humans have forgotten the hardships of former years, and there are some short-sighted cretins among us who not only fight for power and money, but also have no scruples about slaughtering their own race for a wee bit of profit. Whenever I hear of such news, I so wish I can kill all these cretins with my three-foot longsword."

As he spoke inflamedly, a fleeting bout of immense power from his body caused the entire room to tremor.

Ye Qingyu could sense the indignation, anger, and deep abhorrence in Ren Puyang's words.

He knew this feeling all too well.

Previously, this was his attitude toward some sects in the Heaven Wasteland Domain.

After leaving the Heaven Wasteland Domain, the sinister and shameless Black Moon Immortal Palace and the despicable and ruthless Four Stars Sect also enabled him to experience this kind of anger. He had imagined many times before that if there were fewer degenerate Human Race sects like the Black Moon Immortal Palace, and if all Human Race sects could truly unite, then perhaps the Human Race's status and deterring force in the Vast Thousand Domains would be much higher and greater.

"How about this, you can go resolve the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect's matter on my behalf," Ren Puyang spoke unhurriedly and smiled restrainedly at Ye Qingyu.

"Huh?" Ye Qingyu did not expect to be put in charge of this matter.

Ren Puyang nodded with his expression gradually becoming serious, "Yes, that's settled then. At present, the domain grading of the Heaven Wasteland Domain will require at least a month's time to complete every aspect of the handover. You cannot remain idle during this time, and must do more things and gain more experience in order to attain greater recognition from both outside and inside the Human Race."

Ye Qingyu looked at Ren Puyang.

He noticed from the latter's serious expression that this was not a joke.

He suddenly felt a little puzzled.
Why does this Human Race spokesperson sound like he's training a successor?

"Are you sure?" he inquired. "But, in the Heaven Wasteland Domain..."

"Let the empress handle the internal affairs of the Heaven Wasteland Domain." Ren Puyang cut him short, "It's such a small domain anyway. If you have to handle everything yourself, it can never truly become powerful. There once was someone just like you but was proven to be wrong, and so you have to change your way of thinking. In my opinion, you're already the greatest human of your generation, and so you ought to have a plan, vision, and way of doing things befitting of the greatest human, and mustn't limit yourself to the Heaven Wasteland Domain any longer."

This...

These words truly caused Ye Qingyu to feel a little warm-blooded.

But...

"Mr. Ren Puyang, why do I get the feeling that you're just too lazy to deal with the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect's troubles yourself, and that's why you're sweet-talking me into running an errand on your behalf?" Though unconvinced, Ye Qingyu eventually nodded his head. "Alright, I shouldn't have any problem handling this, but what should I do with those traitors of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect..."

"Kill them all."

Ren Puyang answered without waiting for Ye Qingyu to finish speaking.

These simple words completely determined the fate of those treacherous elders of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, and gave Ye Qingyu a cold sweat on his back. He suddenly realized that the grinning and self-disrespecting middle-aged man in front of him was an authority who held power over life and death within the Human Race, and whose one word could decide many matters. Perhaps, the fate of countless Human Race forces also rested on a single thought of this man.

However, Ye Qingyu could understand and agree with this decision.

The internal situation of the Human Race was simply too chaotic at present. Perhaps, the ostensible peaceful state of the various races among the Vast Thousand Domains for thousands of years had caused many humans to forget the tragedy of humans becoming the slaves and sacrifices of foreign races during ancient times. Conflicts and battles had begun among many human forces, such as the Four Stars Sect, the Black Moon Immortal Palace, and the Greater One Sect. The Ancient Sky Dragon Sect's matter was a highly typical example. Saddened and feeling remorseful because of Tian Huayu's death, Ren Puyang, in a fit of anger, wanted strong-handed methods to be used so as to serve as a warning to others and send shockwaves through the other human sects and forces.

Moreover, it was only such a complete delegation of power which would allow Ye Qingyu to have little scruple while carrying out the task. He could thereby make swift and ruthless decisions, and exert the greatest amount of deterring force in the shortest time.

After some more careful deliberation, Ye Qingyu even wanted to thank Ren Puyang.

By assigning this task to him, Ren Puyang was indeed hoping that he could quickly become famous. After all, fame was an extremely important aspect to a martial expert. As the saying went, one's fame follows one everywhere one goes. Only with fame could one attain power, and only with power could one rise up. What Ren Puyang was trying to do was to use the fastest and most effective means of getting him to rise up with the winds.

This was, indeed, very attentively helping Ye Qingyu to grow.

After Ren Puyang said a few more words, the white-robed divine guard called Xiao Lin came in to report that Yu Xiaoxing had settled a few procedures in the congress divine temple, and that she was already in the side hall waiting together with Qin Hui and her son.

Hearing this, Ye Qingyu stood up and took his leave.

During the instant when the guard entered, Ye Qingyu realized that Ren Puyang, who was so busy that he had not left Heaven Connect City for sixty years, did not have the free time to chit-chat for any longer, and so it was time to leave.

Apart from repeating some advice, Ren Puyang did not say much else, allowing Xiao Lin to bring Ye Qingyu back to the side hall.

After watching Ye Qingyu's figure disappear into the corridor, Ren Puyang closed the door and heaved a long sigh of relief, with a strange bright luster forming in his eyes.

"A roc inevitably rises, borrowing the strength of the wind to soar ninety thousand kilometers high... My dearest Ye Qingyu, the Human Race has been short on talent for too long, and so you'd better not let me down."

This juggernaut of Heaven Connect City sighed lightly.

...

In the corridor.

"His Excellency smiled more times today than he did for the past half a year. He hasn't been in such a good mood for a really long time." After bringing Ye Qingyu to the portal formation which led back to the side hall, Xiao Lin suddenly said while activating the formation.

========================================

Chapter 835:


Chapter 852 - The Huntdown Has Arrived



"Is that so? Perhaps something went his way today, and that's why he's in a good mood." Ye Qingyu casually remarked while roughly understanding what the white-robed divine guard meant. He could not help revealing a smile when he recalled Ren Puyang's self-disrespecting look in front of him.

"It's not because something went his way." Xiao Lin shook his head and looked at Ye Qingyu with a somewhat meaningful expression. After a brief pause, he stopped beating around the bush and got straight to the point, "I think he's happy because of you, brother Qingyu. Don't you know, Mr. Ren Puyang has an elegant nickname called [Ironface] in Heaven Connect City. He smiles very little, and would only feel in a better mood when meeting young human talents. Still, he has never smiled as many times as he did today when meeting you. He has to attend to myriad issues every day and is always up to his eyes in work, such that he would not spend more than thirty minutes even when receiving other powerful figures. Only you can stay for such a long time in his office."

Xiao Lin's intent was very obvious. This was an ingenious way of flattering Ye Qingyu and pointing out Ren Puyang's great regard for him.

Ye Qingyu was somewhat astounded and shocked when he heard this.

He had earlier discerned Ren Puyang's regard for him - Ren Puyang himself had even mentioned training him and having high expectations. However, the guard's words gave him a point of comparison, allowing Ye Qingyu to find out that Mr. Ren Puyang's expectations of him were a lot higher than he had initially thought.

"Perhaps he just happened to have some free time today." He laughed.

"Hoho, His Excellency never has free time. I've served him for a hundred years and have never seen him been free for a moment. If not for his painstaking efforts to prop things up in Heaven Connect City, the place of the Human Race in many domains would've gone rotten by now." The guard sighed.

Being Ren Puyang's confidant, he had seen too many people and things while following beside Ren Puyang all these years, and was fully aware of Ren Puyang's pains. As he spoke, he betrayed his own heartache and distress.

Ye Qingyu looked rather surprisedly at Xiao Lin, who he had just gained a much better impression of. After a brief pause, he quipped, "As they say, severe illnesses have to be treated using strong remedies. One should have the heart of a bodhisattva and act like an asura. If something is rotten from its roots, then the roots have to be pulled out."

The latter's eyes lit up.

Although he had heard the ideas and aspirations of several other human talents he met and could tell that every one of them had great ambitions, none of them were in accord with Mr. Ren Puyang. Only Ye Qingyu's ideas were very similar to those of Mr. Ren Puyang in recent years, which were formed over several hundred years of watching the Human Race, experiencing hope and disappointment, and conducting reflection, investigation, and experimentation. Instead, at such a young age, Ye Qingyu already had agreeable ideas. No wonder Mr. Ren Puyang would permit himself to spend so much time with him and smiled so much more than usual.

"These are fine words, Lord Ye Qingyu. It's just that having the heart of a bodhisattva while acting like an asura may result in too much killing, which would eventually incur some disapproval," he could not refrain from adding.

"I'll not be fazed even if opposed by ten million people." Ye Qingyu laughed faintly and spoke no more.

When Xiao Lin saw Ye Qingyu's expression, he knew that the latter was not joking and probably had his own plans already. Therefore, he too laughed and said nothing else.

He had already said what had to be said.

Any more would be unnecessary.

Although Xiao Lin dared not claim to have a complete read on Ren Puyang's thoughts, yet being the most capable bodyguard of this powerful juggernaut, he nevertheless could clearly spot the changes in the expression and tone of the latter, who had all along cherished talents greatly, after this emerging talent of the Human Race named Ye Qingyu appeared in the congress divine temple.

This was why he displayed a very polite attitude toward Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing and provided them with many reminders while guiding them in participating in the domain grading.

After traversing the path, the two arrived in front of the silver spatial formation splendor at the depths of the portal divine temple.

"Please enter, brother Qingyu."

Under Xiao Lin's guidance, Ye Qingyu walked into the portal formation once more.

...

In the side hall.

It had been a full two hours since the Heaven Wasteland Domain's grading result was announced.

Standing in the doorway of the side hall's back door, Ye Qingyu paused momentarily and swept a cursory glance across, noticing that the side hall remained as bustling and boisterous as before.

In the side hall, there were approximately more than three hundred half-partitioned seats, on every one of which sat a representative from one of various races and domains among the Vast Thousand Domains. Like the most crowded and popular restaurants in Heaven Connect City, this place never had an empty seat, and demand always outstripped supply.

Upon close inspection, Ye Qingyu could see that some old faces had left while many new faces had arrived. For instance, the human sect master who made insulting remarks toward Qin Hui was nowhere in sight.

Evidently, during the time when Ye Qingyu was away, people were continually brought into the core divine temple from the side hall, while more representatives and leaders from various races entered the congress divine temple and were sent here to wait.

As he observed the bustling crowd of representatives who were awaiting the judgment of their destinies, he, for some unknown reason, suddenly had a very weird feeling - that although the people who can come here are each an extraordinary being of the Vast Thousand Domains, they ultimately can never be freed from the cage...

Accompanied by Xiao Lin, he entered the side hall and walked toward his earlier seat.

While passing by some seats, there would occasionally be a few human compatriots and representatives from friendly foreign races nodding a greeting at him.

He quickly spotted the seats of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.

At this time, Yu Xiaoxing was already back on her seat, talking to Qin Hui about something. The smile on her face indicated that the empress was in a pretty good mood and vigorous vitality.

A smile involuntarily formed at the corner of his mouth as he walked over.

He was noticed by Yu Xiaoxing.

"Elder brother Ye Qingyu." A brilliance flickered in her eyes at once, and her voice could barely conceal her excitement. Evidently, she had received quite a number of good news when settling the handover procedures earlier.

Nodding, Ye Qingyu was about to say something to Yu Xiaoxing when he saw that Qin Hui and her son, both of whom were also seated, wore rather strange expressions on their faces. They cuddled together with their bodies drawn back, as if they wanted to hide behind the one-meter-tall partition, and revealed a hard-to-disguise look of fear and awe.

Ye Qingyu was taken aback.

Huh?

What's the matter?

Didn't Ren Puyang come over already? Could he have failed to account appropriately to them? Why do they not look any relaxed, and on the contrary, seem even more frightened than before?

Ye Qingyu was bewildered.

"Big brother! The bad guys have arrived!"

Perhaps because Ye Qingyu had mentioned that he knew Tian Ning's grandfather, the little boy trusted him greatly. Upon seeing Ye Qingyu, the boy could not refrain from speaking up, and even waved his pudgy fists as if to muster up his courage. However, his timid expression and unconscious trembling completely betrayed his state of mind.

The bad guys have arrived?

Ye Qingyu seemed to realize what this was about,
"Could the people who're hunting down this mother and son have found their way into this congress divine temple?"

When he looked at Qin Hui, he noticed that this young mother, who was originally extremely decisive and resolute, now could not hide the anxiety and tension on her face.

...

She was indeed feeling very anxious at this time.

Having been pursued by the rebels of her sect, watched her husband die in battle and her kin follow him into death, and fled in distress, she and her son smacked of landlubbers tossed into a boundless ocean in the danger-ridden Heaven Connect City, where they could be slaughtered at will.

Doing everything she could to come to the congress divine temple was akin to the final and only piece of driftwood she could grab hold of.

However, after waiting for five or six days in the divine temple and still not hearing anything from
that
personage, she could not help becoming increasingly despondent and nearly lost the will to persist.

That was until she met Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing, these two human compatriots.

She had earlier already noticed that this young human named Ye Qingyu was shown a friendly and respectful attitude by many foreign race representatives ever since he entered the side hall, testifying to his extraordinary fame and status,

In particular, when she found out that he knew her father-in-law, her crumbling faith was reignited.

Holding the last glimmer of hope, she handed the jade token to him. At that moment, it was equivalent to placing her and Ning'er's lives in his hands.

After Ye Qingyu went away, a middle-aged human who called himself Mr. Ren Puyang did arrive to find her and her son. She presumed that he was the personage whom her dead husband had mentioned. After arriving, he asked a few questions about what she and her son had encountered. However, what worried and frustrated her was that, after asking these questions, he did not explain how he would help them, and simply told them to wait here for news before he promptly turned and departed.

Wait.

Yes, it seemed like yet another endless wait.

Throughout the entire process, this important person, whom her dead husband had said could help her and Ning'er, did not behave very warmly and did not smile. The expression on his face suggested that he was not too willing to get involved in this matter.

This reality caused Qin Hui's heart to be inundated with disappointment and fall into a bottomless dark abyss.

However, for some unknown reason, her heart was stirred up when Ye Qingyu reappeared in front of her.

Perhaps it was because of his extraordinary yet steady bearing, or because of his confident and firm attitude, but in any case, Qin Hui's nearly-dead heart was offered a faint ray of hope.

Having merely met by chance, it was already too kind of him to have helped her find the personage. If she now requested protection from him, it would be equivalent to pushing this warm-hearted young man toward the rebels of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect and thereby putting him in harm's way.

Chapter 836:


Chapter 853 - White Clothes, Black Hair, and Ice Sword



Standing to the side, Yu Xiaoxing naturally understood that Qin Hui was already heavily confused, judging from her expression. Sighing softly, Yu Xiaoxing looked at Ye Qingyu and said, "Before I rushed back here, there were some people causing trouble outside. I heard that there are a few divine temple guards, together with some other people, blocking the doorway. They seem to have come for elder sister Qin and her son."

Because he had an excellent impression of Qin Hui and sympathized greatly with her misfortunes, Ye Qingyu had by now started to call her an elder sister.

He nodded.

"It's... those rebels from the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect." Qin Hui finally calmed her nerves, albeit her tone remained somewhat alarmed. Filled with a strong hatred, she gnashed her teeth and explained, "That scoundrel, Elder Mingjue, must've somehow found out that we were here and bribed a few divine temple guards to allow his pursuit. He's one of my husband's murderers, and is intent on killing our whole family!"

So that's the case.

After he finished listening, Ye Qingyu roughly understood.

Speak of the devil indeed.

To think that these people from the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect are actually this impatient and have arrived so fast. However, because this place is protected by divine guards, nobody without a nameplate is able to barge their way in, and so Elder Mingjue and the rest can only stay put outside.

Their tentacles have yet to reach into the side hall.

Still, this kind of environment cannot be any more dangerous for Qin Hui and her son.

Making eye contact with Qin Hui's fear-filled eyes, he said laughingly, "Mr. Ren Puyang has put me in charge of this matter. Don't worry, with me around, nobody from the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect will be able to lay a finger on you or your son."

These words were cocky indeed.

However, they were not just hot air. The master of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, Tian Huayu, was initially able to control the sect despite only having the cultivation of the Pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm. When he was alive, those rebels did not cause any disturbance, showing that their strength was, at most, also at the pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm, which Ye Qingyu had little regard for even though his strength had not yet fully recovered.

Moreover, he had the colossus that was Ren Puyang backing him up.

In his current state of mind, he was completely unafraid of the coming of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect rebels, and was instead more worried of them giving up, which would deny him a reason to take action.

Qin Hui's eyes lit up and stared fixedly at Ye Qingyu after she heard those words.

"Wonderful! Mama, big brother says he'll protect us!" Despite his young age, Tian Ning understood what Ye Qingyu meant and jumped up excitedly at once.

Since some time ago, this young child had begun to have complete trust in Ye Qingyu and believe that he could fulfill all of his promises.

However, Qin Hui certainly did not think the same way. As the matriarch of an ancient sect with such a long and rich history as the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, she naturally understood the implications and stakes involved. Although Ye Qingyu appeared to be of high status and could even associate with Mr. Ren Puyang, he was after all just a young human whose strength and status were not on Mr. Ren Puyang's level, and thus it was not guaranteed that he would be able to protect them and deal with those rebel elders and disciples.

Nevertheless, as much as she had her worries, she had little choice.

Among the myriad domains, there was probably no one but Ye Qingyu who was willing to protect the two of them.

"Don't worry, just follow us out. I'd like to see which wretched thing would dare to touch you while I'm around." Ye Qingyu had absolutely no misgivings, having been advised by Ren Puyang.

"That's right, you don't have to worry. Since elder brother Ye Qingyu has promised to help you, both of you will be safe." Yu Xiaoxing smiled tenderly, also looking rather confident.

Although the Heaven Wasteland empress did not know what Mr. Ren Puyang said to Ye Qingyu after she left, or why the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect's matter would suddenly be given to Ye Qingyu to handle, she believed that Ye Qingyu definitely had his ideas and plans for him to have taken responsibility.

Seeing the situation, the white-robed divine guard Xiao Lin pondered before saying, "If that's the case, why don't I escort the few of you out? I also want to see what these people who dare to cause trouble outside an Alliance of Domains divine temple side hall look like."

By following them out, he could not only help but also remind Ye Qingyu not to create too much of a fuss, for this would be in violation of the Alliance's laws, it being within the area of an Alliance divine temple after all.

"Thank you so much." Ye Qingyu nodded.

The party of five quickly arrived at the doorway of the divine temple.

As soon as Ye Qingyu stepped out of the divine temple while leading Qin Hui and her son, a long swishing sound was heard before several dozen flickering figures charged up to the party from oblique directions and surrounded them without allowing any explanation.

Their leader was a lanky, long-bearded old man with an aquiline nose, a gloomy face, and malicious eyes. Giving off a radiance while huffing and puffing, he was clearly a cruel and malevolent man. The extremely powerful aura from his body also indicated that he had attained the pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm and was just short of the Half-Saint realm.

Aside from him, there were three black-armored divine guards and six middle-aged experts wearing standardized long robes. Their auras were not too weak either, being at the Immortal Step realm, and their faces looked extremely fierce. Inconspicuously, they had blocked off the party's route of retreat back to the side hall.

Sweeping a glance across these people, Ye Qingyu simply sneered without saying anything.

Instead, it was that lanky aquiline-nosed old man who spoke in a chilly voice after casting his sharp gaze across Qin Hui and her son with a strong killing intent, "Bitch, how dare you act so unwomanly and betray your sect. You must've gone mad to run to this kind of place. Unfortunately for you, justice has long arms. Looks like you finally cannot bear it any longer and have decided to come out of hiding. Now, be good and return with me to be disciplined..."

Qin Hui became so angry that she convulsed all over.

Elder Mingjue is truly deceitful and distortive of the truth. To think he would lay the blame on and slander me when he's clearly the one who has betrayed his sect and hunted down the master's descendants.

"Mingjue you scumbag, don't you dare slander me like this, you..." Although Qin Hui possessed martial cultivation, yet being a woman after all, she had lived a comfortable life for too long and was thus unable to say anything too heated. Plus, because her hate was too deep, she could not complete her sentence.

Elder Mingjue did not even take a second look at her.

She was already dead in his eyes, and so he felt there was no need to say anything further.

His gaze fell upon Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing, who he studied for some time. Seeing that they were young, did not bring any guards with them, and did not look like important personages, he paid them scant respect and sneered, "My two young friends, do you happen to know this bitch and want to intervene? Hoho, this is a family matter of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect. I would urge you not to butt in and instead to leave quickly for your own sake."

Ye Qingyu looked at this smug fellow and smiled without saying a word.

Seeing that they were not budging, the elder's face darkened, "You two little children, the adults in your families should've reminded you before that there are some things you shouldn't get involved in just because you're feeling energetic and impulsive. I shall give you another chance to leave on your accord."

Ye Qingyu smiled once more.

It was a smile that contained pity and contempt.

As he looked at the elder, he casually raised a finger and counted the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect's men, saying, "One, two, three... six. Hmm, six people in total. Your luck is not bad, I'm in a pretty good mood today and don't want to kill anyone, or otherwise this scumbag's pretentious show of might would've resulted in seven dead bodies... Get lost."

Elder Mingjue's countenance changed at once.

Upon hearing these words, one of the experts behind the elder stepped forth without any hesitation and pointed at Ye Qingyu's nose, scolding, "Little bastard, who do you think you are to say this kind of thing in front of Elder Mingjue of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect? You must be tired of living, you..."

Before he finished speaking.

Swish.

A beam of cold light flashed across the air.

The expert's body stiffened abruptly. His raised finger remained in mid-air while the other hand was covering his neck, where a sword mark had appeared. His throat made weird coughing noises while his expression was that of astonishment and terror, with his entire being seemingly petrified. The latter half of his admonition would never be uttered.

Standing opposite him.

Ye Qingyu's hand had been clutching a one meter plainly-crafted longsword since some time ago.

A trail of fresh blood bounced up and down like mercury at the fuller part of the sword tip and moved along with the sword tip.

Holding the silver-colored sword horizontally across his white-robe-covered chest, Ye Qingyu moved with a natural yet indescribable elegance, before he blew a mouthful of air at the sword.

Patter.

The trail of blood fell to the ground along the sword tip.

The liquid blood had turned into icy jade beads in mid-air and thus made pattering noises when they landed on the ground. Although they then fragmented, there was absolutely no smell of blood, and instead there was a kind of melodious noise.

Before anyone could react, they saw a silver layer of cold air burst out from the expert's body, which turned into a sparkling and crystal-clear ice statue in a flash. Everything, be it the robes, weapon, flesh, bones, or viscera, became jade-like ice before fragmenting with a bam and turning into bright silver-colored ice bits that scattered on the ground...

The entire place was silent for some time.

The whole world quietened.

Elder Mingjue stared with wide-open eyes which were filled with incredulity. For some time, his mind was blank, unable to believe anything he was seeing. From the beginning, he did not believe for a minute that anyone would dare to use force in front of a divine temple side hall of the Alliance of Domains, and would even kill so brazenly.

This... young man, where is he from?

The other experts of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect were also completely stunned, a few of them with teeth shivering uncontrollably. By following Elder Mingjue these days, their status within the sect had risen greatly, affording them a taste of power and causing their egos to swell to the extreme. Therefore, when they came to Heaven Connect City and the Alliance's divine temple, they behaved extremely arrogantly and conceitedly.

However, even if they had been even more arrogant or crazier, they knew full well the consequences of using force to kill in this kind of place.

As such, since the beginning, their intention was only to take Qin Hui and her son away by force, and was never to kill the two of them here.

But now, one of their own had been killed here.

That electric flash of sword light was like a mysterious spirit and could be called a divine technique. Despite also being known for their swordcraft, the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect was completely floored by that stroke which was as chilly as an ice cave.

White clothes, black hair, and ice sword.

Who exactly is this young man?

How can he dare to kill here?
