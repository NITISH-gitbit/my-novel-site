Chapter 17:


Chapter 17 – Terrifying Talent

From the memory of the burly teacher, there were extremely few students, who in their first training of the [Serpentine stance], would be able to perform it so perfectly.

This Ye Qingyu, no wonder he had ninth grade talent and was able to cause the flame flowers on the talent torch to bloom.

The burly teachers gaze was full of compliments, about to say something. But very quickly, his gaze was frozen with shock again!

Because Ye Qingyu started to practice the second stance.

It was another perfect performance.

The burly teacher could even feel the aura of a vicious snake emitting from Ye Qingyu…

“This… he not only has imitated the form, but he seems to have grasped the true essence of the stance!”

The burly teacher, at this moment, was astonished.

This Ye Qingyu, did he study the [Serpentine stance] before? Otherwise how was it possible … Was this really the terrifying talent of someone who activated the nine flame flowers?

Afterwards, when Ye Qingyu started to practice the third stance, other students began to notice his actions.

Ye Qingyu body was like a snake, sometimes hiding, sometimes arching up violently, his body so flexible it was as if he possessed no bones. In this moment in time, it seemed as if he had really transformed into a real snake, moving along the ground.

When he practiced until the six stance, he was like flowing water, completing every move in one breath. It was as if he had practiced this thousands, if not tens of thousands of times before! “[A Viper’s Poison]!” Ye Qingyu loudly shouted.

As his hands moved, hisses started appearing in the air. It seemed as if there really was a humongous viper swallowing prey and spitting poison, causing people to feel fear.

“[Divine Snake Moon]!”

Ye Qingyu performed the last move.

The burly teacher was so shocked he was about to bite of his own tongue.

He had been teaching the basics of training one’s body for over ten years in White Deer Academy. He had seen various geniuses and strange talents, but he had never seen anyone like Ye Qingyu. Someone like Ye Qingyu, who by only observing the [Serpentine stance] of the [Eight Divine Stances] once, and was able to replicate and grasp the true essence of it, this was his first time seeing such a monster.

If this teenager did not practice the [Serpentine stance] beforehand, then this was really too frightening. Did he have an eidetic memory? His ability to understand could be titled as prodigious.

This type of teenager seemed to be born for the martial path.

The gaze of the other teenagers around were also filled with complicated expressions of shock, jealousy and admiration. Several adolescents who possessed incomparable confidence in themselves, when they realized they could not even complete the first stance of the [Serpentine stance], was thunderstruck when they compared their efforts to Ye Qingyu.

The burly teacher gave the teenagers a glare, sternly shouting, “What are you looking at, quickly go practice! Try and understand it on your own, if you have any areas you don’t understand, then come back tomorrow and ask me.”

The teenagers snapped out of their dumbfounded states. Ye Qingyu’s performance stimulated them, making everyone concentrate and work even harder.

When Ye Qingyu finished performing all eight stances of the [Serpentine stance], he felt that his entire body was hot, filled with a type of heat that was trying to escape, his blood boiling.

He slowly inhaled, adjusting his breath.

Then, he started his second iteration of the form.

The burly teacher did not say anything more, silently standing at the sides of the practicing grounds. His gazed seemed to look around at every student, supervising their training, but the majority of his time and attention was focused on Ye Qingyu.

The more he observed, the more shocked he was.

When he practiced the [Serpentine stance] for the fifth time, the burly teacher was certain that the youth had already completely understood the essence of this form. It was as if he was a martial artist that had practiced this skill for tens of years, every move perfect, no matter whether you considered the form or rhythm.

What was even more unbelievable was that as Ye Qingyu continued to perform the [Serpentine stance], under the sunlight, the teenager’s skin seemed to produce a golden reflection.

This was a sign of the first stage of the Ordinary Martial stage!

The burly teacher could not believe the sight before his eyes, he felt his understanding of martials arts being completely broken by this teenager — In the seventh iteration of the [Serpentine stance], he had already managed to achieve some success in the first stage of the Ordinary Martial stage?

Supernatural!

How was this possible?

This could no longer be explained by just natural talent.

Just what of kind of secret was this teenager hiding? ……

Ye Qingyu continuously went through the motions of the [Serpentine stance].

If at the start his body was slightly tentative, then now as time passed, he was already completely immersed in the process of training his body.

As the eight stances became smoother and smoother, Ye Qingyu felt every inch of his body, every muscle and bone, and every inch of skin become activated through the stances of the [Serpentine stance].

Within his body, there was a flame-like thing that was originally buried deep within, but at this moment, it seemed to be stimulated.

Ye Qingyu could feel his body become hotter and hotter, his blood was as if it was burning. He could feel a type of energy that wanted to escape through the pores of his skin.

Ye Qingyu’s mind was extremely clear.

He suddenly remembered the words that that the burly teacher said earlier, the chant for training in the Ordinary Martial stage that was less than a hundred words. The words that was not quite understood, suddenly became clear, his actions becoming more coordinated.

The mysterious energy that wanted to gush out of his body was subconsciously stopped.

A strange feeling spread out through his entire skin.

It was an extremely comfortable feeling, filled with excitement.

Ye Qingyu repeated stance after stance of the [Serpentine stance].

Near the end, he did not follow the order that the burly teacher taught but randomly mixed the sequence of the stances. He moved according to his will, his heart deciding on the order of the stances.

Time, under the shedding of sweat by the teenagers, quickly flowed by.

Ye Qingyu did not know how many times he practiced the [Serpentine stance]. Only when he started to feel strains of fatigue did he stop, his mental state awakening from cultivating.

“Eh? You guys… what are you doing?”

Ye Qingyu only just noticed that the teenagers had already surrounded him, forming a small circle with the burly teacher at the front.

Everyone was staring at him unblinkingly.

Their gaze was as if they were looking at a monster.

The teenagers were speechless.

The burly teacher did not say a word, only walked over and grabbed Ye Qingyu’s right arm, observing carefully. In his eyes, a strange light appeared, and he even carefully felt Ye Qingyu’s exposed skin in detail.

“The first stage of the Ordinary Martial stage, the skin stage you have already full completed… How did you manage to do this?”

The burly teacher reached his conclusion, staring steadily at Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu himself was also slightly confused. He shook his head saying, “I… don’t know!”

The burly teacher was taken aback.

He could tell that Ye Qingyu was not lying.

At this moment, he did not know what to say.

The teenager in front of him, only by training in the [Serpentine stance] for two hours caused his entire skin to clear and smooth, his skin as if it was a layer of pale gold, incomparably soft and flexible. This evidently was the peak of the first stage of the Ordinary Martial stage.

What is monstrous?

This was!

At the start, when the burly teacher saw Ye Qingyu being able to perform the entire [Serpentine stance], he was already extremely shocked, but right now… He was very nearly going numb.

Disregarding Ye Qingyu, the burly teacher took a deep breath to recover. He turned around and look at the surrounding youths.

“After watching for thirty minutes, I’m sure that even the most stupid out of you should be able to see some insights in the stances, and can obtain something from this. Ye Qingyu has monstrous talent, being able to see me demonstrate the [Serpentine stance] once and remembering it all. Instantly learning it is his ability and also your good fortune, to be able see a grand master performing and for half an hour too…”

The teenagers quietly listened to the teacher’s lecture.

“Of course, you don’t need to be impacted by this. Ye Qingyu’s monstrous talent is his own business, you don’t need to compare yourself with him. You only need to remember that every one of you has gone through the strictest of examination before being selected, each of you is a real genius. You are exceptional when compared to your age group and the martial path does not care about who is first or last, only about those who can finish walking this path – right now Ye Qingyu is walking faster than you, but who says you cannot overtake him?”

The burly teacher’s gaze swept across the teenagers who were disheartened from Ye Qingyu’s performance. His tone was filled with encouragement.

The teenagers loudly shouted in reply.

A smile appeared on the burly teacher’s face, then he nodded his head saying, “End of class!”

Then he did not look at Ye Qingyu, directly leaving.

But Ye Qingyu knew, the things that happened here today, the burly teacher would definitely report it to the higher ups of the academy in the shortest amount of time.

Ye Qingyu could feel that the burly teacher was a good person.

The burly teacher did not neglect the other students because of his shining performance. And at the end, the words that he said, partly was to encourage and inspire the students to prevent them from being dispirited, but it was also to help Ye Qingyu, to stop the other students from isolating him.

Within White Deer Academy, there were still good people.

Trash instructors like Liu Heng was still in the minority.

……

After eating dinner at the canteen, Ye Qingyu returned to the dormitory.

He was thinking about what had happened in the afternoon.

He had only repeated the [Serpentine stance] ten times before reaching the peak of the skin stage. This was slightly hard to believe. Even if the [Serpentine stance] was the ideal method to train your skin, but to reach such a level, this could not be the only reason.

For a normal person to reach the peak of the skin stage, not only would they have to cultivate in the correct technique, but they would also have to use medicinal baths. If they were slow, this would take several years, if they were fast, several months. Even a genius needed one or two months to reach this stage, and this was already extremely shocking…

But he himself…

Ye Qingyu had always had unshakeable confidence in his own talent, but the things that happened here today could not be explained by his talent alone. It was too ridiculous.

So what was the reason?

After long thought, Ye Qingyu could identify two reasons as to why this might be.

The first was the nameless breathing technique his father had passed on to him. The second… was the heroic brass badge?

The nameless techniques background was extremely mysterious. He had already trained in it for over ten years, but he could still not see the benefits to him apart from making him have herculean strength.

========================================

Chapter 18:


Chapter 18 – [Bear stance]

The second reason, the brass badge, came from a normal background. However, before his father died, he had constantly reminded him that the badge had secrets that he needed to discover on his own.

However, it was a pity that both reasons were just guesses.

Ye Qingyu had no way to tell whether they were true.

He carefully examined his skin. Just from a quick glance it seemed nothing had change, but if you examined it in detail, there seemed to be a pale gold layer appearing on his skin. He brought a kitchen knife, lightly slicing it across his skin but it could not pierce the skin, as if he had sliced it on leather.

This really was the peak of the skin stage of the Ordinary Martial stage.

This was exactly as described by Wang Yan in the theory lesson.

“No matter what, to be able to cultivate this fast is a good thing. Especially when I am currently in a rush…” Ye Qingyu was not the type of person to become fixated on one thing, since he can’t find a reason, he would not think about it.

He stood up to stretch his body.

Ye Qingyu could feel that the [Serpentine stance] did not only toughen his skin, but also after entering the first skin stage, he could feel his strength had increased.

He slowly swung his fist, feeling as if such a casual punch could break apart a boulder to pieces.

The martial realm was indeed profound.

As he was about to continue training in the dormitory, a knocking sound came from outside.

Tap, tap, tap!

“Excuse me… is this brother Qingyu’s room?”

Outside, there was the voice of the little loli, Song Xiaojun.

Ye Qingyu stopped, then remembered that he had promised the little loli to help her change the robes that was too large for her.

He opened the door, inviting her in.

Ye Qingyu could feel his vision brightening up.

After changing from the large academic robes into a fitting purple dress, the little loli seemed to be a completely different person. Her thick black hair was combed with her fringe hanging neatly over her forehead with her hair forming two little buns with intricate braids hanging from it.* Her large eyes were as pure and clear as a crystal, with delicate facial features giving people an impression of perfection.

This was not a type of stunning beauty, but rather an extremely cute little girl who was like a little porcelain doll.

“Brother Qingyu, I’ll rely on you.” The little loli laughingly lifted up her large robes, passing it over.

“Sit.” Ye Qingyu pointed at the stone seat, then took out a needle from the cupboard he used to store his things.

“How did brother Qingyu learn how to sew clothes?” the little loli curiously asked.

“When you live on your own, you have to do everything by yourself,” Ye Qingyu said this with a smile, carefully inspecting the little loli’s figure and calculating the length of cloth that he needed to change.

For some unknown reason, he had a special goodwill towards this little loli.

Is it because within the eyes of the girl was a pure innocence that made him feel warm inside?

“That’s right, this afternoon, head teacher Wang personally came and taught us martial arts…” The little loli thought of something, saying excitedly, “She’s really awesome, many areas in which I don’t understand through just from a few pointers from her, instantly becomes easy to comprehend. Today I learned a lot!”

The little loli was part of the list of ten, along with Qin Wushuang and Yan Xingtian. Their martial lessons, were taught personally by head teacher Wang Yan.

“Qin Wushuang is really amazing, head teacher Wang says his strength is the strongest of the freshmen. He already has a spirit kindling within his body…”

“But Yan Xingtian is only a little worse. Today, head teacher Wang Yan personally gave him a [Growing Spirit Manual] and said that he could hope to attempt to reach the Spirit spring stage in three months!”

“Of course, my Sister Cousin Qingluo is also awesome, she is already at the peak of the Ordinary Martial stage. Head teacher Wang said she also had the requirements to attempt to reach the Spirit spring stage in three months.”

The little loli spoke about everything, and was like a little chatterbox.

Ye Qingyu listened with a smile.

Through the little loli’s words, he began to have a clear understanding of Qin Wushuang and the others. Just from judging through the current situation, there was still a considerable gap of strength between him and them.

“That’s right, brother Qingyu, I have an extremely fun thing that you can look at.” The little loli seemed to have suddenly thought of something, looking mysterious. From her pouch, she took out a black booklet, handing it over.

Ye Qingyu laughingly received it, taking a look and was slightly shocked.

“Hm? [Xiantian Growing Spirit Manual]?”

It was a martial arts manual.

From the name, it should be a manual that taught you how to develop your yuan qi.

The peak of the Ordinary Martial stage was also known as the peak of the Ordinary Martial stage. This was a barrier, and after passing through this barrier, the next stage was Xiantian. Xiantian was to grow a spirit kindling in your body, and link it with the yuan qi within Heaven and Earth. And within days, this would turn into a Spirit spring, flowing with yuan qi.

Although Ye Qingyu had not yet read the book but just from the two words, ‘Growing Spirit’, he could already guess the contents of the manual.

This booklet was inky black with a shade of purple, evidently extremely precious and not something a normal student would be able to obtain.

Ye Qingyu, through a little consideration, could tell that this [Xiantian Growing Spirit Manual] was the cultivation technique given to the little loli by head teacher Wang Yan. It should not be something that was passed to outsiders.

He smiled and patted the head of the little loli saying, “I don’t need this at the moment, quickly put it away.”

“But it’s extremely important. Why don’t you have a look, maybe in the future you will have a use for it,” the little loli insisted, not wanting to give up.

“When I need it in the future, then you can show it to me, is that okay?” Ye Qingyu seemed as if he was coaxing a little child. If Wang Yan knew that the little loli had passed on this manual to others she would definitely be punished.

Furthermore, Ye Qingyu was currently only in the first stage of the Ordinary Martial stage, and did not yet have to worry about reaching Xiantian just yet.

The little loli sullenly stored away the booklet, her mouth so flat it could hang an oil bottle.

After a short while though, the little figure seemed to have thought of something again, her eyes shining with sneakiness. She playfully stuck her head out and said, “Brother Qingyu, I heard that you have an eidetic memory, everything you’ve heard, you can remember?”

Ye Qingyu, after hearing this, already knew what was about to happen. He felt slightly helpless when facing this strange and quirky little loli.

As predicted, the next instant the little loli began reciting.

What she recited, was the contents of the [Xiantian Growing Spirit Manual].

Ye Qingyu only smiled and did not say anything.

After he had finished changing the robe, the little loli had already recited the [Xiantian Growing Spirit Manual] over ten times.

Under this time of force fed indoctrination, Ye Qingyu managed to memorize over eighty to ninety percent of the manual.

“Fine, fine, you little cunning brat, if you want to thank me next time you should use some other methods. If not, if head teacher Wang found out, then you would be heavily punished!” Ye Qingyu handed over the adjusted robe, flicking the little loli’s head.

“Annoying.” The little loli’s face flushed red, sticking her little tongue out.

……

After the little loli left, Ye Qingyu continued practicing the [Serpentine stance].

After this afternoon’s training, every move and meaning of the [Serpentine stance] was deeply ingrained within his brain, and now it was almost a natural instinct.

And hence when he practiced in the small dormitory, he did not feel stifled at all.

It was an extremely strange feeling.

After every time he finished performing the eight stances of the [Serpentine stance], Ye Qingyu was able to feel his own body undergoing a mysterious change. There was a strange and mysterious heat that was stimulated from within, changing his body.

After an hour, he finally started to feel tired.

He stopped and fixed his breathing. Ye Qingyu emptied his mind, and then sat on a meditative posture on the stone bed, continuing his training with the nameless breathing technique.

His breathing was slow and deep.

After vaguely realizing the value of this breathing technique, Ye Qingyu began to pay more attention to it.

After approximately one hour.

Ye Qingyu ended his breathing meditation.

The fatigue on his body had disappeared entirely. He felt his vitality improve many times over. The time was already midnight, but it was as if he had just woken up, filled with energy and not feeling tired in the slightest.

This was the effects of the nameless breathing technique.

Then he continued training in the [Serpentine stance].

This entire night, was spent repeating this cycle.

This continued on until the sun started to rise. Only then did Ye Qingyu end his training.

At this time, he could confirm that he has absolutely broken into the first skin stage of the Ordinary Martial stage. This type of speed, apart from making Ye Qingyu surprised, also made him extremely excited.

What the cold Bai Yuqing said was not wrong. He was later than others by four years, and this meant there would be a chasm between him and the others. But if he could continue to cultivate at this kind of speed, then no matter how big the chasm, it could be overcome!! ……

Dawn.

The fragrance of flowers filled the air.

Ye Qingyu had just finished eating breakfast, exiting from the canteen.

He discovered that after training in the [Serpentine stance], something in his body seems to have been stimulated. Not only was his training speed extremely rapid, his appetite also seemed to have greatly increased.

Just then he had eaten over twenty mantous**, ten bowls of congees*** – at least six portions of a normal person’s meal.

“If this continues, I’ll eat myself poor…”

He burped loudly.

In today’s morning lesson, it concerned the essences behind the [Serpentine stance]. For those students who had only begun to learn this technique, it was naturally immensely important.

To absorb the previous experiences of those who had gone through this path before in a lesson was an unavoidable shortcut for many of the students.

But for the Ye Qingyu who had already thoroughly digested the [Serpentine stance], todays lesson held no meaning at all.

After considering for a while, he headed straight for the practicing grounds.

The burly teacher was currently teaching another class.

“Why have you come… eh?”

The burly teacher saw Ye Qingyu, casually asking. But at the next instant, he was like a rabbit that had its hairs plucked out. In a flash, he was in front of Ye Qingyu, carefully inspecting him, his mouth forming an ‘o’ shape.

“The perfection of the skin stage, and you already have one step in the second muscle stage. You motherfucking… are you the reincarnation of the martial god?” The burly teacher was so shocked that he couldn’t help but swear.

Ye Qingyu smiled and just laughed.

“Hmph, fine, I know what you little bastard has come here for. In the [Eight Divine Stances] the [Serpentine stance] is more beneficial for refining that skin, but their effects on the muscles is average.” The burly teacher considered for a moment, quickly understanding Ye Qingyu’s intention.

He nodded his head saying, “After, I’ll pass on the [Bear stance] to you. Out of the [Eight Divine Stances] it is the one most suitable for training the muscle.”

*I know I messed up the translation of her description, so here’s a picture of her hairstyle xD ** Steamed buns *** Savoury rice porridge

Chapter 19:


Chapter 19 – Liu Lei

“Thank you, teacher,” Ye Qingyu thanked him respectfully.

The burly teacher waved his hand, allowing Ye Qingyu to enter the practice grounds.

Then he walked to the middle of the grounds, shouting at the other students. “Okay now, little fellows stop for now. In this class, the majority of the students have already reached the first skin stage, now I will pass on the [Bear stance], the stance best for training your muscles. Watch closely…”

The burly teacher stood with his feet wide apart, his entire aura changing. He was suddenly completely serious, as if he was an ancient bear, instantly emitting an aggressive atmosphere.

“The bear, has the slowest personality but also the most majestic. They have the strongest muscles, even stronger than tigers. You have to remember seven key words ‘knock’, ‘pounce’, ‘tear’, ‘lean’, ‘hold’, ‘roar’, ‘jolt’. Look carefully…”

The burly teacher began to move.

Ye Qingyu observed extremely carefully.

The muscles of the burly teacher suddenly bulged and expanded, as if he was really a bear. Although his movements were slow, but every move was filled with strength, demonstrating the seven keywords perfectly.

The movements of the [Bear stance] seemed to be simpler than the [Serpentine stance]. But the essence of the [Bear stance] was not in the movements of the body but in the movements of the muscle. Every move needed to be coordinated with the actions of every major muscle group. To be able to truly grasp it, the difficult was definitely above that of the [Serpentine stance].

After going through all the stances, the burly teacher hid his aura and gave everyone a glare. “Have you all seen it clearly?”

Every student’s reaction was different.

The foundation of these students was better than the class Ye Qingyu was previously in, with the majority being in the first skin stage of the Ordinary Martial stage. The burly teacher also utilized this opportunity to teach the [Bear stance] to Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu, after seeing it once, immediately began practicing it on the side.

Very quickly, he was able to perform the entire [Bear stance] once.

“This is really more difficult than the [Serpentine stance]. To move the all the muscles of the body in a coordinated fashion needs a great amount of practice…” After finishing the first iteration of the [Bear stance], he did not instantly begin the second iteration like yesterday but rather thought for a while before continuing.

Seeing this, the burly teacher nodded to himself.

Teachers also treated those students who were better at learning with bias, this was human nature. If the students performed well, it would make the teacher feel successful.

This was what the burly teacher was feeling right now.

This was the reason why he paid special attention and care to Ye Qingyu.

When Ye Qingyu went through the fourth repetition of the [Bear stance], the burly teacher could not help but sigh in his heart with admiration.

Was this a monster’s talent?

If the previous three repetitions only looked like the real deal but did not have the essence of it, not yet truly grasping the spirit of the [Bear stance], then this time was different. In this iteration, there was no longer any errors or mistakes, every muscle group coordinating with the seven key words and creating perfection.

Time passed on.

In the entire morning, the burly teacher spent his time mostly in a state of astonishment.

Because when the time was noon, not only had Ye Qingyu fully perfected the [Bear stance], he had also reached the second muscle stage of the Ordinary Martial stage.

Even though after seeing the incident yesterday, the burly teacher had already prepared his heart, but he still could not help but be stunned.

It was not yet two days. If he continued at this speed, then would this little bastard only need tens of days to reach the peak of body refining and enter the Xiantian stage?

What kind of monster was he?

The training continued.

The training of the [Bear stance] was different from the training of the [Serpentine stance]. To truly grasp the seven keywords, some equipment needed to be used.

Within the center of the practice grounds, there were some walls and pillars made of steel. The students would ‘strike’, ‘pounce’ and ‘lean’ against the steel equipment to speed up the effectiveness of the training.

This type of training was extremely painful.

The stronger the impact, the more likely it was that bruises will be formed.

Luckily, White Deer Academy had already prepared medicine for the treatment of bruises and a medicinal bath. When they needed it, the experienced eyes of the burly teacher would pick out the students who showed signs of injury and request for them to stop.

Very quickly, there were tens of figures in the medicinal bath in the center of the practice grounds.

Bang!

Ye Qingyu hit against a steel wall ferociously.

It produced a huge sound, as if a hammer was striking it.

He did not seem to show the slightest of expression, as if he did not feel pain.

He was topless, sweat oozing from his tanned skin. The sweat looked like jewels under the bright sunlight, causing Ye Qingyu to emit a primitive sort of magnificence.

In these types of impact, the muscles in his shoulder and back received endless refining.

Following the method of the [Bear stance] could greatly lower the risk of injuries. It would cause the muscles in your body to be like steel, the constant impacts removing any impurities in your body and becoming steel.

Pounce, lean, hold, strike…

Different movements, trained different muscles.

PangPangPangPang!

Loud sounds of impact were endlessly produced.

The other students were starting to feel numb.

When they saw Ye Qingyu’s crazy method of training that was akin to torture, they were all shocked. They were sure that this method was paramount to suicide, and that he would definitely not be able to keep it up for long. But when Ye Qingyu continued to endure with an expressionlessness face, in their minds they were sure that this teenager was not a human being.

What was even more shocking was that in the entire process of the torturous training, Ye Qingyu did not even jump into the medicinal bath once to get rid of his bruises.

There were several times that the burly teacher wanted to forcefully stop Ye Qingyu’s training. But every time, after inspecting his body, he could discover no hint of bruises within his body.

Ye Qingyu’s body was as tough as a demonic beast.

Apart from Ye Qingyu, after an hour of training in the [Bear stance], there were no students who did not use the properties of the medicinal bath to get rid of their bruises.

Time passed on.

It was nearly midday.

“Okay, today’s training will end here.” The burly teacher gaze moved away from Ye Qingyu, clapping his hands and shouting, “There is still around half an hour till the next lesson, everyone can stop and spar with each other a little…”

This was one of the specialties of lessons within White Deer Academy.

When the lesson was about to end, they would allow the students to spar with each other. This had the effect of deepening their understanding and was a beneficial supplement to the lesson.

It was also an activity that caused the students to feel the most excited.

Ye Qingyu also stopped what he was doing.

Because he was surrounded by the most people.

The students were not idiots. They could long tell that Ye Qingyu’s understanding of the [Bear stance] was quickly approaching master level. They would naturally seek to receive pointers from him, wanting to know what insights he has about this body training technique.

Ye Qingyu did not hide anything, demonstrating all his insights…

At this time, suddenly—

“Haha the little trash has started to teach others. It looks like you are pretty self-confident…” a loud voice filled with provocation travelled over.

Everyone looked over to see the source of the voice. Five or six students that did not belong in this class had already unknowingly come to the practice grounds.

Liu Ye was one of the people in this group.

These six students with faces filled with arrogance, entered the practice grounds.

The teenager leading them had a long thin figure. He had a hooked nose with long eyebrows, and in his eyes, was the dangerous glare of a wild beast.

“You are Ye Qingyu?” the teenager with the hooked nose asked, staring at him.

Ye Qingyu nodded his head. “And you are?”

“I’ve heard you are very arrogant and don’t care about noble students.” The hook-nosed student licked his lips, then said with a smile, “I only want to know, who are you, that you dare to be so arrogant?”

Ye Qingyu was about to say something but the little kids around him was already reacting. Feeling the tension in the air, their tone became unfriendly.

“What class are you guys?”

“We are currently in a lesson, you dare interrupt us?”

“Whether he is arrogant or not, what does this have to do with you? We are in the middle of a lesson, please leave!”

The students in the class were all protective of Ye Qingyu.

This was partly due to the fact that they were impressed by Ye Qingyu’s efforts during the training and partly due to the fact that Ye Qingyu showed them his insights regarding training without reservation.

“Haha…” The hook-nosed teenager laughed lightly, his glance passing through the crowd. He said, “A group of trash, the weakest and most pitiful worms of White Deer Academy dares to bark in front of me. No medicine can save you from your own idiocy…”

Before he had finished…

The hook-nosed teenager fiercely punched.

Boom!

One of the steel pillars used to train the [Bear stance] was as if it was struck by lightning, violently shaking. A clear imprint of his fist was clearly marked three fingers deep on the steel pillar.

“This…”

“A terrifying strength!”

“Could this be the strength of a Spirit spring expert?”

The originally angry students were stunned, everyone with their mouths opened wide, their expressions dazed.

This kind of strength had already exceeded their understanding.

Just by casually striking, he had left such a deep imprint on the steel pillar. The fist of the hook-nosed teenager was unmarked and unblemished; this was definitely not the level of strength of the Ordinary stage.

“How about it? You over-confident little trashes, are you starting to feel scared? That’s right, the little trash called Ye Qingyu, I hear you are very cocky and confident; right now do you want to have a spar with me?”

The hook-nosed student laughed, provocatively gesturing at Ye Qingyu with his finger.

“That’s enough Liu Lei, stop now,” the silent voice of the burly teacher suddenly spoke. “Don’t cause trouble, this is the classroom and is not the place where you can go rabid.”

So the name of the hook-nosed teenager was called Liu Lei.

The burly teacher seemed to recognize him.

Liu Lei was ranked seven in the examination results and was one of the talents that the White Deer Academy placed great attention on. He was from a wealthy background and was also mad about martial arts. He was young but he did not know how to pull his punches.

He had a brutal personality. Before entering the academy, he had already killed or caused major injury in over forty people in various competitions. When he goes crazy, he cared about nothing.

Chapter 20:


Chapter 20 – Direct Confrontation

It was said that in yesterday’s afternoon class, Liu Lei had already injured a commoner student during sparring. Thankfully, the instructor present at the time managed to stop him, before more damage could be done.

The student from a common background needed to rest for one month before he could recover.

The burly teacher admired Ye Qingyu and did not want him to get injured.

“Eh? Teacher Wen, what are you saying?” Liu Lei let out a laugh and said, “The last thirty minutes of a lesson, hasn’t the academy always encourage students to spar with each other?”

He said this while looking at Ye Qingyu.

In his glance, there was evident mockery and contempt. Liu Lei laughed, “Haha, what about it? Causing such a big scene at the selection, aren’t you very cocky? Why have you now turned into a turtle? Not even daring to accept such an ordinary sparring match, and hiding behind the backs of others…”

Ye Qingyu did not say anything, instead looking at the Liu Ye who was hidden inside the crowd.

Liu Ye was standing behind Liu Lei, his face showing a poisonous and devious smile.

It was an expression that said his plan had worked.

This time, although he was slightly afraid, he did not avoid Ye Qingyu’s gaze. On the contrary, he returned the gaze challenging him, soundlessly mouthing something.

But from the shape of the mouth, one could obviously tell that it said six words, “You are definitely going to die!”

Ye Qingyu understood.

This was definitely not a coincidence.

Liu Ye had definitely done something behind the scenes to make the hook-nosed youth cause trouble for himself… That’s right, they had the same family name, they should be relatives.

It looks like he was too light last time. This idiot didn’t have a good memory!

He wanted to borrow someone else’s sword to kill someone?

But I’m afraid your sword is not sharp enough!

After thinking this thought, Ye Qingyu looked at the fist imprint on the steel pillar. He had already calculated the power in that fist.

The lips of Ye Qingyu curled in a smile.

He looked Liu Lei up and down and said with a laugh, “A spar? Fine, but I fear that your body is too thin, it’s so similar to a thin gibbon. I’m afraid that you won’t be able withstand my strike, and I might accidentally kill you with one punch!”

“What?” Liu Lei was slightly taken aback, then laughed as if he had heard the greatest joke in the world. He said, “You… kill me? Haha, hahahaha…”

Liu Lei, along with several youngsters that he came with all started laughing.

“I’m laughing to death, he said he would be able to injure Senior Brother Liu Lei….”

“Does he even know how many people that Senior Brother Liu Lei has beaten to death before?”

“The retard yesterday also said similar words, and the result? Right now he is still lying on his bed, the doctor saying that he would need a month before he could walk again…”

“Hahaha, arrogant, too arrogant!”

Liu Ye and the others laughed.

“Good, I originally didn’t have much of an interest in you, but who would have thought you are so arrogant.” Liu Lei laughed like a madman, licking his lips. “A commoner as conceited as you is so rare… If you have the abilities, even if you kill me, I can guarantee that the Liu family will not take any action.”

“Since you are looking to die, then come…”

Ye Qingyu slowly walked to an unoccupied area of the practice grounds.

The burly teacher was anxious, wanting to stop this but he saw Ye Qingyu shaking his head.

In Liu Lei’s eyes there was a dangerous glare like that of a snake about to swallow its prey. Step by step, he walked till he was ten meters apart from Ye Qingyu.

“I’m about to… start!”

Before the last word, ‘start’, had already been finished, Liu Lei had already taken action.

His footwork was extremely agile, and in nearly a blink, had close the gap between him and Ye Qingyu, striking his fist out.

The air exploded like thunder.

The air moved violently, currents of wind blowing.

This entire process was as fist as lightning.

The bystanders gasped with unsuppressed shock.

Too quick!

It was so quick that it was impossible to react to.

Ye Qingyu in the instant he was about to be hit, suddenly moved. It seemed like it was just luck or he had calculated the trajectory of the punch, but he avoided the strike by a hair’s distance.

“Hehehehe….”

Liu Ye’s wrist moved, his punch becoming a claw. There was a faint red glow on the fingertips, as it was a red hot steel claw, relentlessly clawing at Ye Qingyu’s shoulder.

This time its was even quicker.

“This is… battle technique!” someone shouted with shock.

“This is not fair. Liu Lei has already learnt how to use techniques while senior brother Qingyu has only begun to train…”

“This is bad, both the [Serpentine stance] and the [Bear stance] are methods to train one’s body and not techniques used in battle. They don’t have any practical use… Senior Brother Qingyu is in danger!”

Within these exclamations, Ye Qingyu looked as if he was extremely lucky once again, narrowly avoiding Liu Lei’s second move.

The face of the burly teacher was also anxious, breathing quickly. When Ye Qingyu could not endure it anymore, he would stop this match no matter what.

Boom!

Liu Lei once against missed his strike, hitting the ground.

The ground slowly cracked, spreading out in a spiderweb pattern on the stone tiles. The center of the stone tiles had already been turned into smithereens. One could imagine, if that strike had landed on a person, what the consequences would be.

Liu Lei evidently was looking to kill!

The group of teenagers were covering their mouths, with those who were afraid covering their eyes.

If this continued on, within ten moves, Ye Qingyu definitely could not avoid any longer.

“Haha, aren’t you very cocky? Why are you evading…”

“Little trash, you don’t dare to receive one of my moves?”

“Haha, look at you, what is the difference between you and a frightened mouse…”

“Don’t run, you’re like a dog, so shameful. Quickly let me kill you with one of my punches… Hehehe!”

Liu Lei became more and more crazy.

His footwork became more and more bizarre, his hand constantly changing from a fist to a claw. He was evidently utilizing an impressive battle technique that utilized his entire power with terrifying results. The air around them exploded with the unceasing sound of thunder, and the wind around them was like a stormy sea breeze.

Ye Qingyu’s figure also kept changing his position with difficulty.

Every time, he would nearly be hit and be sent flying.

But every time he manages to avoid at the last second, as if he had the most ridiculous luck in the world. He mysteriously avoided these life threatening strikes, managing to survive.

Astonishment slowly began to appear in the burly teacher’s eyes.

And those students who had covered their eyes had already opened them again.

“This… It looks like the [Serpentine stance]”

“Senior Brother is using the [Serpentine stance] to evade… how is this possible, can the [Serpentine stance] be used in this way?”

“How can a technique used for basic body training be used in a real battle?”

Gradually, the students began to realize the secret of how Ye Qingyu was able to evade.

They would never have thought that the basic body refining technique, [Serpentine stance], could be used in battle. Ye Qingyu’s body was like a snake, incomparably agile and flexible as if he had no bones in his body. He utilized the [Serpentine stance] to its fullest, and the brutal strikes of the battle technique of Liu Lei could not even harm Ye Qingyu in that slightest.

Was this what a genius was?

Even the worst techniques, in his hand, could bloom with such incredible brilliance?

“Time to end this.” Ye Qingyu moved his body, using the [Teng Snake in the Fog] stance, appearing four or five meters away. Widening the distance, he said, “You’re technique, I have already entirely seen through. There are nine punches and six claws, there is no need to compete anymore. Next, I will defeat you in one strike!”

“Defeat me in one strike? Hahaha, little trash, I will kill you in one strike!”

Not being able to hit his target, Liu Lei was already mad but hearing this made him even more furious.

When had he been treated with such disregard?

Slamming his foot into the ground explosively, Liu Lei was like an eagle catching his prey, as fast as lightning. His left hand was a claw and his right hand was a fist, striking a killing blow against Ye Qingyu.

Using claw and punch at the same time!

It was his strongest technique!

Ye Qingyu did not move from his position, a bright light appearing in his eyes.

As the body was about to land onto him, he ducked rapidly. Liu Lei’s claw and fist both impossibly missed and went past him and in that instant, Ye Qingyu’s shoulder moved upwards like lightning.

This move, was part of the [Bear stance’s] keywords, the ‘knock’.

Simple and unpretentious.

But at this instant, Liu Lei was as if he was facing the most frightening technique in the world. Because, he found that he could not avoid this move at all.

An indescribable ability to grasp the opportunity.

Boom!

The Liu Lei who was in midair seemed to stop for an instant, then it was like he was attacked by a battering ram. Letting out a smothered grunt, he flew away.

Gasps of shock could be heard.

Liu Lei staggered about, looking flush. He fiercely bit his lips together, managing to not spurt out blood, his chest heaving…

This strike was like a mountain had fell on him. There was a huge pain in his chest, as if he had broken several ribs. This type of strength and impact was enough to make him feel frightened.

In reality, even Liu Lei did not understand how he was defeated in an instant.

Because he had practiced in both the [Serpentine stance] and [Bear stance], and having mastered it entirely, he had completely disregarded it. But in Ye Qingyu’s hand, it became incomparably unfamiliar, even his [Nine Moves of Soul Stealing Talon and Fist] could not withstand it!

At this time, Liu Ye and his friends were all dumbfounded.

They could not believe what had happened in front of their eyes.

Liu Lei was… sent flying?!

He was defeated by such a simple stance in the [Bear stance]?

Was this a joke?

“Haha, hahahaha…” Liu Lei also began laughing, his eyes shining with the dangerous light of a wounded best. “You’ve actually injured me, actually injured me… This is not over until one of us dies, haha, I will definitely tear you to pieces!”

“Eh?” Ye Qingyu laughed. “Wasn’t this just a spar? How did it turn into a fight to the death?”

“Fuck your mother, who’s sparring with you? I’m going to beat you to death today…” Liu Lei crazily laughed, tears appearing in his eyes. “I’m going to beat you till you die…”

This person had gone crazy!

“Pretending to be crazy after being injured slighty, his personality is really poor…” Ye Qingyu provocatively waved his finger. “You’ve really scared me to death, come then, beat me to death!”

“You motherfucker… you scumbag trash, if you dare then don’t avoid me!”

Liu Lei could feel that he was being made fun of, swinging his fists with his entire strength.

This fist, after being enraged with anger, was definitely stronger. Sounds of thunder could be heard and one could vaguely make out air currents being warped around the fist. Compared to the fist that dented the steel pillar, this was more terrifying many times over!
