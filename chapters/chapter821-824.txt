Chapter 821:


Ye Qingyu also believed that Wang Zhen would not let go of such an opportunity.

As long as he was given enough time, Wang Zhen must be able to extract all the pharmacological and medical scriptures from these doctors of Heaven Connect City, for his usage. When Wang Zhen understands the mainstream medical knowledge of the great wide world, he would certainly have a breakthrough, increasingly improve, and in due time, the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps would have a true master of medicine.

That was the real purpose of Ye Qingyu.

After coming out of the main consultation hall, Ye Qingyu went to see the Great Dragon Turtle Demon.

He had purchased the
Violet-Gold Dragon King Ginseng
g, which could keep the Great Dragon Turtle Demon alive temporary. Ye Qingyu used some method and ensured that the Great Dragon Turtle Demon would not die within one month. Now they needed to find a way to change his fate.

After all, the Great Dragon Turtle Demon's life yuan had been burned out, and what Ye Qingyu was doing was equal to competing against Heaven and earth. It was exceptionally difficult.



However, he had to give it a try.

After visiting the Great Dragon Turtle Demon, Ye Qingyu returned to his quiet room.

He continued his cultivation and recovery.

While understanding Medical Scriptures, trying to find a complete treatment for the Great Dragon Turtle Demon.

……

Time flew by, and another day passed in the blink of an eye.

The golden glimmer of dawn forced away the dim light of night, light poured onto the square and pavilions of Green Xuan Hall, reflecting a colourful luster, like it was a paradise.

In the reception hall.

Dressed in a red robe, an adorable and silly figure that looked like the Maitreya Buddha was sat on a carved armchair, wiping the sweat on his face with a smile.

“Old fatty, you're finally here!”

Ximen Yeshui was still standing in the corridor but his loud voice had already reached the hall.

Earlier, Luo Yi had informed them that the fat elder, Yan Wushuang, had arrived. The few leaders of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps, who were discussing official businesses in the meeting room, could not sit still any longer, especially Ximen Yeshui, who had turned into a stream of water-coloured flowing light right away and teleported to the reception hall.

“Hey... I was just giving you guys enough time to recharge, or how can you enjoy the sensual pleasures of the outside world... Hahaha...” The fatty elder was still smiling, rubbing his bulging belly.

After not seeing him for a few days, the old fatty's persuasive skills were still as good as ever.



Immediately afterwards, Ye Qingyu, Yu Xiaoxing, and Old Fish came in successively.

“Woof... let's stroll the Flower Street! Old fatty, take Woof to the Flower Street!”

A small ball of white fur was smooth and soft, but the tips of his fur were a scorched yellow colour. His round figure pounced onto the shoulder of the fat old man.

It was silly dog Little Nine who appeared to have fully recovered his mental and physical strength.

The crowd roared with laughter.

Ye Qingyu looked at the fatty elder, finding it strange, he asked, “Why do I not see Elder Shuang?”

Usually, these two brothers were inseparable from each other. Everyone in Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had already gotten used to the fact that where the passionate-like-fire Elder Yan was, there would definitely be another icy-cold sculpture-like Elder Shuang.

“Hey, hey... speaking of which, I should thank little brother for your gift... It's truly against the will of the heavens. Although us brothers have helped you a lot and a lot and a lot, and are considered your saviour, haha, I still feel guilty accepting such a valuable gift...” The fat elder Yan Wushuang was laughing so much that his eyes were squinting, yet he still tried to squeeze out a look of shame. He looked comical and ridiculous. With his dark little eyes rolling around, he continued, “My brother doesn't like these kinds of activities, and he has received your treasure so he is busy cultivating. Even though I am itching to cultivate too, I am just too kind-hearted. After completing my duty I rushed over right away.”

Ye Qingyu nodded when he heard this and then gave a faint smile.

That Yan Wushuang was never serious in his speech, no wonder he could get along with Ximen Yeshui and Old Fish.

Friends are drawn to each other by common tastes!

“Don't talk nonsense, let's go, get out of here, I've been anxiously waiting these few days,” Wen Wan urged.

Although there were famous chefs of Heaven Wasteland Domain accompanying them, but ‘Noodle Wen’ had long wanted to eat to his hearts content in Heaven Connect City.

“Don't be impatient, I've brought you some hot news!” Yan Wushuang blinked his small eyes and gave a sly smile.

“Huh? What news?” Ye Qingyu was very curious.

After the assessment, Ye Qingyu was very clear that the fatty elder and the other Elder Shuang Wuyan were both kind-hearted people, and that they were both very concerned about Heaven Wasteland Domain. In particular, since they belonged to the Domain Alliance and their status was not low at all, the information that they had must be extremely important to Heaven Wasteland Domain.

“Hehe... In the past two days in Heaven Connect City, there were rumours that Ye Qingyu of Heaven Wasteland Domain had stolen the treasures of the Dragon-Human clan. The Dragon-Human clan came to the door to ask for it back but not only did he not return it, he insulted and seriously wounded the Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan. He really is despicable...” ——

Chapter 822:


Chapter 839 - Disturbance in Heaven Connect City



As he spoke, Yan Wushuang's eyes gleamed with excitement and his hands were crossed over his chest, as though he was waiting for the show to begin. He looked exactly like those old men in teahouses who gossiped over tea and wine.

"That Third Princess of the Dragon-Human race was in the wrong and yet still dared to release such a slanderous statement. She is really hopeless..." Yu Xiaoxing's eyes flashed with anger.

"I don't think it's just the Dragon-Human race who are trying to stir up trouble this time. This piece of news has spread like wildfire, and at this point in time, all the major cities along the Road of Chaos have heard of this incident. This has started to become a major topic of discussion and the signs hint at a major incident happening soon. There are definitely other forces at work secretly aggravating the situation. It is obvious what their true motive is." Yan Wushang scratched his red hair and wiped the sweat off his forehead. "Oh yes, I heard the true experts of the Dragonblood Dynasty have already made their move and are making their way to Heaven Connect City. I guess they have decided to make their move..."

Ye Qingyu laughed indifferently at Yan Wushuang's words.

However, the faces of the few leaders from the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps turned grave.

"If the Dragonblood Dynasty's status and resources are richer than that of the Black Moon Immortal Palace and if they really do come after us, I'm afraid with our current strength... Brother Ye Qingyu, shall we inform Master Ren Puyang of this and ask him to come forward..." Yu Xiaoxing was a little worried but she could not think of the best way to proceed.

Although a "hotshot" like Ye Qingyu was part of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps, they were still low on resources and would never be able to go up against a megaforce in the Vast Thousand Domains.

"Don't worry. I have my own methods to deal with this. If they want to attack us, let them come. We might as well use this as an opportunity to settle everything," Ye Qingyu said, a picture of calm.

When the others noticed his expression, they knew that Lord Ye Qingyu had already formulated a plan, and so, they started to relax as well.

"Hehe, good! I like how arrogant and confident you are, it reminds me of how I used to be. Hahaha. It is no wonder why I admire you so much; you are even more courageous than I was back in those days!" Old Fish's eyes flashed slightly and he laughed while clapping his hands, as though he was a teacher who had produced a brilliant student. He looked like someone who was just waiting to watch the action, as if the matter did not concern him at all.

"Woof... I knew that I selected the right master. He takes after me! Hahaha..." Little Nine added, wanting to join the fun. It waved its paws about, looking extremely proud of itself.

Oh my god.

Ye Qingyu suddenly felt like strangling that stupid dog.

Who takes after you?

You're not my father.

"Although it's good that you're so confident, do take heed that a starving camel is still bigger than a horse. The Dragon-Human race is still one of the most ancient and respected mixed races across the myriad domains, and they are extremely powerful and rich in resources. You mustn't underestimate them." Yan Wushuang looked at Ye Qingyu, a cheerful smile on his face, completely hiding his true emotions.

Grateful, Ye Qingyu nodded seriously and said, "Elder Yan, many thanks for your advice. This matter can be easily resolved and I will make the necessary preparations."

After they exchanged a few more words, Ximen Yeshui, Wen Wan, Old Fish, silly dog Little Nine, and the others could not wait to head out with Yan Wushuang to explore and enjoy the pleasures of life.

-

They had suffered a lot during the Battle of Chaotic Storm, so this trip to Heaven Connect City was also a time for them to relax and unwind. Ye Qingyu knew that despite their unreliable appearance, they were all highly intelligent, so he knew he could count on them to suss out the situation in Heaven Connect City.

Silly dog Little Nine had whined and insisted on tagging along but Ye Qingyu was not too comfortable with that arrangement. This stupid dog was not very bright and it relied on its innate ability to phase through anything without being restricted by formations to create trouble everywhere it went. Ye Qingyu and his companions were used to its antics.

However, Heaven Connect City was not like the other cities, and with the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps' current predicament, Ye Qingyu was concerned that malicious people might take advantage of the situation if Little Nine really caused trouble.

On second thought, he figured that if he prevented Little Nine from leaving, it might sneak out on its own in a petulant fit. Then, without Old Fish and Wen Wan to keep an eye on it, it might cause even more trouble. Furthermore, Little Nine had sustained serious injuries after the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had been ambushed and it could be said that he had rendered outstanding service to the diplomatic corps. It would be cruel of him to stop it from having fun.

Fortunately, they were accompanied by Yan Wushuang. His tactfulness and diplomacy should ensure that Little Nine stayed out of trouble.

Upon further contemplation, Ye Qingyu ultimately did not stop Little Nine from leaving.

After the group departed, the Green Xuan Hall descended into complete silence.

A faint floral fragrance wafted throughout the great hall and the sound of the murmuring stream was extremely soothing to the senses.

Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing strolled down the corridors of the waterside pavilion and headed toward the western annex.

They did not exchange a word throughout, but the camaraderie they shared was worth more than a thousand words.

...

They spent an entire afternoon visiting the injured, and after they were informed that the injured were at various stages of recovery, Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing finally felt completely reassured.

All of that visiting and enquiring had left Yu Xiaoxing completely exhausted, for she had not completely recovered either.

Ye Qingyu hurriedly summoned two men to escort her back to her quarters. She had to make use of this time to rest and recuperate. Most importantly, she had to regain her strength.

As he gazed at her departing figure, slim and frail but with a hint of resoluteness, Ye Qingyu could not help sighing inwardly.

He did not know whether it was right or wrong for such a young girl, a fresh-faced beauty, to bear the weight of a kingdom and take on the responsibility of an entire domain.

After Yu Xiaoxing left, Ye Qingyu returned to the quiet room and continued to make use of the time he had to regain his strength.

Although Ye Qingyu did not feel pressurized nor threatened by Yan Wushuang's news, he was worried that fights or skirmishes detrimental to the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps might break out.

Only by regaining his peak condition could he stand a better chance of protecting the soldiers who had given their all to the Heaven Wasteland Domain and who trusted him unconditionally, as well as the heroes who had laid down their lives for the domain.

Time flew by and soon afterward, it was the afternoon of the second day.

There was a commotion in the square outside the Green Xuan Hall.

Old Fish and Little Nine each held one end of a rare toy in their hands and glared at each other, both refusing to let go. Wen Wan and Ximen Yeshui stood beside them and watched gleefully. These idiots had returned noisily.

A moment later, in the meeting hall of Green Xuan Hall—

"Hehe... Heaven Connect City truly lives up to its name." Old Fish was still yearning for more.

Similarly, Ximen Yeshui looked as though he could not get enough of Heaven Connect City as he exclaimed, "This trip to Heaven Connect City has been a real eye-opener. I would have never imagined that such a lively and exotic city could exist in the myriad domains... It was said that that woman was a female martial goddess of the various large sects. Haha, they were all even prettier than the fairies of the Jade Pool..."

"Indeed. Heaven Connect City also has all kinds of rare noodles with many strange and exotic varieties. Haha. I didn't get to try them all..." Wen Wan said with a look of regret.

"Woof... One more glass..." Silly dog Little Nine was surprisingly tipsy.

It was a battle pet blessed with heaven-defying innate talents who had tried all sorts of good wine across the Heaven Wasteland Domain, so it was surprising that it would get slightly tipsy.

No one knew what kind of divine wine he had tasted this time.

Ye Qingyu looked at their expressions and did not know whether to laugh or cry. He realized something and asked, "Has Elder Yan Wushuang left?"

Wen Wan finally recalled something and dug out a red jade pendant with the mark of fire and handed it to Ye Qingyu. "The Alliance of Domains summoned him to attend to an urgent matter. That old fatty left this for you before he departed and said it contained new information about Heaven Connect City."

Ye Qingyu took the jade pendant and gave it a gentle rub. Then, a blood-colored light curtain appeared out of the jade pendant.

"The information contained within largely corresponds to what we were told yesterday. In recent days, all sorts of slanderous rumors about the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps have been making their way through town," Wen Wan said seriously, a rare occurrence for him.

"Yes, as we made our way about town, we realized that it was not only the Dragon-Human clan who claimed that their ancestral weapon was stolen by you, but several foreign race forces also claimed that the treasures their ancestors had left behind in the 18th district were stolen by you. These sects and forces are jointly putting pressure on you to hand over the items or they will come after you!"

Ximen Yeshui glanced at Ye Qingyu curiously as he reported what he had heard. He looked at Ye Qingyu with a conflicted expression and hesitated for a moment before he asked, "Brother, did you by chance... take their treasures?"

"I've only obtained two treasures left behind by their ancestors—one from the Dragon-Human clanand the other from the Seven Fingers race. As for the others, they are just making things up. The 18th district of Black Demon Abyss is extremely vast, so how could I have possibly taken all of their ancestral treasures? I was not the only person who entered that district, and besides, the murderous spirit of heaven and earth exists within that district. Thus, ordinary treasures would have been smashed to pieces long ago," Ye Qingyu said truthfully.

He glanced at the words on the red light curtain and asked with some confusion, "Who are the 'Green Mysterious Abyss Sect' and 'Firecloud Dragon Temple'? Why are they targeting us?"

"They are large forces and I heard that one is a dominant force amongst the evil sects while the other is the descendant of the bloodline of a mythical beast. They are both rich in resources and thus, they are able to have their voices heard in Heaven Connect City..." Wen Wan reported in detail.

"Humph, I heard that these two forces like to stand up for their own while bullying other races. How dare they release such statements to further their own selfish desires now that the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps has come under fire? They are so despicable," Ximen Yeshui said with some contempt.

Chapter 823:


Chapter 840 – Retired Emperor



These were the words recorded on the blood-colored light curtain, "The Green Mysterious Abyss Sect and Firecloud Dragon Palace have both sent representatives to Heaven Connect City to release announcements and proclaim that Ye Qingyu of the Heaven Wasteland Domain has definitely obtained many rare and exotic treasures from the 18th district. However, they were unable to verify whether the treasures he obtained were indeed treasures that their ancestors had left behind, nor would they be able to force Ye Qingyu to hand them over. Therefore, the only way to resolve this matter would be for Ye Qingyu to hand over several precious treasures as compensation to these sects and forces whose ancestors had left ancestral weapons and precious treasures within the 18th district. This would prevent violence from breaking out in Heaven Connect City and maintain the harmonious relationship that each race and sect have with each other."

Ye Qingyu was so enraged after reading it that he could only laugh.

These two sects were really interesting.

He had never seen anyone as shameless as them.

Ye Qingyu mentally blacklisted these two sects.

He would deal with these mischief-makers in the future.

"I can't believe such shameless sects exist in this world. They are merely laying the groundwork for them to steal and plunder in the name of appeasing the various races and forces and maintaining the harmony of the major cities of chaos." Old Fish's eyes flashed and verbalized Ye Qingyu's thoughts.

"These rumors have spread like wildfire and now the entire city is aware of this. The places we passed by yesterday were all discussing this issue. We mustn't underestimate the impact of these rumors," Wen Wan said with a sigh. "If the tide of public opinion turns against us, the consequences will be dire. After all, humans are selfish by nature, so even those forces who had not thought of stealing Lord Ye Qingyu's treasures have started to join in. If the situation continues to worsen, things could get out of hand. These two sects have malicious intentions and this is clearly an overt conspiracy, so we have to deal with it carefully."

The others realized the gravity of the situation after Wen Wan's words.

He was right; if these sects turned the tide of public opinion against them, everyone would start to think that they were entitled to those treasures. If more and more people started to promote this idea, what was unreasonable would become reasonable, and an increasing number of sects and people would join in. Then, Ye Qingyu would be painted as an unreasonable man despite him not being at fault.

As the saying goes, mass spreading of rumors has the power to obscure the actual truth.

The relaxed atmosphere had suddenly turned a little serious.

Ye Qingyu looked at the group and smiled, "In the face of absolute power, regardless of their overt or covert conspiracies, everything will seem like a joke. Rest assured. These sects are merely mischief-makers and are simply not worth our time. They might be gleefully stirring up trouble now, but when the time comes to make them pay, I will make sure that they suffer just as much. Now that we as the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps have the support of a divine god, why should we be afraid?"

Although they did not know where Ye Qingyu's confidence came from, it affected the group and they suddenly felt more at ease.

"Hehe. That's a pretty good idea. Young fellow, now that you have the support of a Quasi-emperor, no one across the entire Vast Thousand Domains can afford to provoke you." Old Fish was stunned at first, then immediately guessed who Ye Qingyu's supporter was.

The others quickly arrived at the same conclusion.

Oh yes. Everyone knew that [Quasi-mperor Xiaofei] had passed the Quasi-emperor decree to protect Ye Qingyu. This proved that the Quasi-emperor supported the Heaven Wasteland Domain. Not only that, the Phoenix Race, Hurricane City, and Black Demon Abyss had also voiced their support in the past… Hmm, they suddenly realized that the Heaven Wasteland Domain had slowly started to grow stronger and they were no longer alone in this.

This made them feel better.

Ye Qingyu nodded and said, "While it's true that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] will support us, more importantly, we will need to rely on ourselves. We must not let our guard down. After all, the Quasi-emperor is such an important character, so he can't always be present all the time. It would be more prudent to rely on our own abilities."

The key figures who were present understood that the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps and Ye Qingyu would have to take extra care in their speech and actions in the future in order to prevent those who harbored malicious intentions from gaining any further ammunition. If their enemies pounced on their weakness, the consequences would be dire and completely unpredictable.

This entire controversy had caused the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps to be treading on thin ice. In particular, Ye Qingyu had to maintain a very delicate balance.

"Oh… one more thing, Little Nine came across this piece of news." Old Fish kicked the tipsy silly dog beside him.

Little Nine immediately awakened from his stupor.

"Old fool, how dare you kick me…" Little Nine bared its fangs at Old Fish, then finally recalled what he had heard, "Woof... That's right. That old fatty earlier mentioned that the expert from the Dragon-Human clan who is making his way here is the retired emperor of the Dragonblood Dynasty. In terms of strength, he is more powerful, and in terms of temper, his temper is worse than yours. So Master, I think you are in danger…"

"Oh?" Ye Qingyu asked curiously, "The retired emperor of the Dragon-Human race?"

Little Nine hiccupped drunkenly, then shook its head and continued, "Hehehe… that's right. The old fatty said that the retired emperor of the Dragon-Human clan is not one to be trifled with. He used to be a famous top expert back in the day and his name was known all across the Vast Thousand Domains. Legend has it that he had fought for the opportunity to become emperor along with [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] and they had battled for more than six months before the winner was determined. He only lost by half a move… Thereafter, he ascended the throne as emperor of the Dragon-Human clan and inspired awe throughout the land. It is also said that he had magically regained his ancestral traits and has cultivated the body of the True Dragon. Thanks to him, the Dragonblood Dynasty has managed to retain a semblance of its past glory. Despite having lost their ancestral weapon, their race has still not been annihilated... Um, this extraordinary character only gradually started to retreat from political life five hundred years ago and does not interfere in Dragonblood Dynasty's business... Anyway, Yan Wushuang talked a lot so this is just a brief summary of what I heard. The retired emperor of the Dragon-Human clan sounds terrifying. Should we flee while we still can?"

Ye Qingyu was left speechless.

This silly dog was going from bad to worse.

It seemed to have become even dumber in the past few days.

As for the retired emperor of Dragonblood Dynasty...

Rather than feeling threatened, Ye Qingyu looked forward to meeting him...

The retired emperor of the Dragonblood Dynasty,
haha,
he sounded like an important figure. This was great. He would take this opportunity to settle the issue with the Dragonblood Dynasty once and for all.

========================================

Chapter 824:


Chapter 841 - Wen Wan's Warning
Little Nine's words had alarmed the rest of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.
Did the retired emperor of the Dragonblood Dynasty possess such a demon-like talent?
Since he had once battled [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], did it mean that he was now powerful enough to defeat the Quasi-emperor?
"Now that you mention it, I've also made some inquiries about him." Wen Wan hesitated, then continued, "It's said that his talent is practically heaven-defying and he is the most outstanding talent that emerged from the Dragon-Human clan in close to six thousand  years. The blood that flows within his veins is the purest Dragon Race blood that has been seen in the past thousands of centuries. He reached the Peak Great Saint Realm five thousand  years ago and is said to be as powerful as the peerless Dragon-Human clan experts who perished in the 18th district thousands of centuries ago. There is also a rumor that he is the legitimate son of the Dragon-Human clan's ancestor."
Ximen Yeshui grew more excited and his eyes flashed. He continued, "It is also rumored that three thousand years ago, this retired emperor overthrew one hundred thirty-six sects single-handedly, of which fifty-eight sects were medium forces, ten were top forces, and two were super forces. In a single night, he slaughtered close to a hundred Saints and a Great Saint... Tsk, tsk, tsk. He is definitely a vicious and cruel character. To be honest, his combat strength sounds terrifying and I'm afraid that my master might only be fit to carry his sandals. Haha..."
Ximen Yeshui was probably the only person throughout the myriad domains who dared to speak of his master in such a manner behind his back.
Ye Qingyu was already accustomed to Ximen Yeshui's manner of speech and pretended to ignore his statement. He looked at Wen Wan and said, "Since he seems like such a formidable character and is almost invincible, why hasn't the Dragon-Human clan regained their former glory after all these years?"
According to his research, the Dragon-Human clan was one of the most ancient races of the myriad domains. With their long history and vast amounts of resources, they were once the indisputable overlords of the myriad domains in their glory days.
Unfortunately, thousands of centuries ago, their ancestor perished and their [Dragon Blood Halberd] was lost in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. Left without a leader, the Dragon-Human clan naturally started to decline.
Over time, as other races started to grow stronger, the Dragon-Human clan gradually started to decline and maintained a low profile.
"Now that you mention it... with the exception of the retired emperor, the rest of the Dragon-Human clan is very ordinary. As the saying goes, each one is worse than the last. It would be extremely rare for the later generations to produce a genius. One tree does not make up a forest and it would be impossible for the retired emperor alone to salvage the situation. He has given his all these past few years to the Dragonblood Dynasty, and a sage once surmised that if this retired emperor had not been distracted by his temporal and worldly desires and devoted too much energy to the Dragonblood Dynasty, he might have already stepped on the emperor's road by this time." Wen Wan heaved a soft sigh, then looked at Ye Qingyu. He looked as though he was about to speak, but ultimately swallowed his words, seeming slightly emotional.
Indeed, one could not help but feel for an expert who was almost at the pinnacle of the martial way whose progress on the martial way had been halted because of the ties to his race and was now unable to make further breakthroughs.
Ye Qingyu was slightly shaken by Wen Wan's words, for he understood the look in Wen Wan's eyes and also understood what he meant by that sigh.
Ye Qingyu's own predicament was extremely similar to that of the retired emperor of the Dragon-Human clan. In the same way that this demon-like talent of the Dragon-Human clan had to support the entire Dragonblood Dynasty, Ye Qingyu himself now had to support the entire Heaven Wasteland Dynasty. To be more precise, the sudden rise of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps on the Road of Chaos was because of the single-handed efforts of Ye Qingyu. With the exception of Ye Qingyu, few amongst the Heaven Wasteland Domain could be considered experts. Even a talent such as Yan Buhui, who was highly regarded in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, would not amount to much here in the Vast Thousand Domains.
If the talents of the Heaven Wasteland Domain were unable to mature fast enough to share Ye Qingyu's burden, as time passed, Ye Qingyu would probably also have to devote his energies to the matters of the Heaven Wasteland Domain. This would definitely hinder his progress on the martial way.
Ye Qingyu could not say anything to relieve Wen Wan's worries.
Now that he was entrenched so deeply within the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he could no longer break free.
One would have to compromise in this world.
"No matter what happens, there is no need to concern yourselves with this matter of the Dragonblood Dynasty," Ye Qingyu said resolutely. He did not reveal much but instead, changed the topic. "We will need to closely monitor what others are saying in Heaven Connect City. Pay close attention to who makes the most vicious accusations and report their names to me. I'd like to see who is aiding the Black Moon Immortal Palace in an attempt to bring us down."
The murderous spirit was clear in his message.
Ye Qingyu's words put everyone's minds at ease.
No one was sure when it had started, but everyone within the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had already placed blind faith and trust in Ye Qingyu. Regardless of how serious the situation might seem, as long as Ye Qingyu said that there was no problem, it was as though everything would truly be alright.
Then, everyone started to relax and feel more reassured.
They talked for another two hours and finally dispersed after the Empress assigned tasks to all of them.
Ye Qingyu returned to the quiet room to continue his self-isolation.
According to the news that Wen Wan and the others had brought back, the situation in the foreign domain, as well as the ultimate expert of the Dragon-Human clan who was on his way here, things were not looking good for the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. Ye Qingyu was still confident but he did not dare to let down his guard.
Most importantly, he had to make full use of the time he had to regain his strength.
Ye Qingyu spent the next few days immersed in cultivating. When he was not cultivating, he went to the western yard to check on the injured members of the diplomatic corps and see how they were recuperating.
Time flew by.
Three to five days went by in the blink of an eye.
After he had subdued those doctors of Heaven Connect City with his thunderous methods the last time, the injured were recovering at a much faster pace and he no longer had to spend vast amounts of resources and money. Wang Zhen also had the other doctors firmly under his thumb. Furthermore, after hungrily absorbing the medical theories and medical way of the Vast Thousand Domains, his vast knowledge enabled him to comprehend new things through analogies. He proposed many alchemical techniques and prescriptions that had dumbfounded the so-called doctors of Heaven Connect City. In a few days, Wang Zhen had fully unveiled his extraordinary talent and skills in the medical way.
Awed by Wang Zhen's talent, the eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City had fully submitted to him and were very cooperative. They had even consulted with Wang Zhen on several issues and engaged him in their discussions. Although they had initially submitted to Ye Qingyu due to fear, their attitudes had changed because of their respect and awe for Wang Zhen.
Just as martial artists continually aimed for progress along the martial way, every doctor would naturally pursue and long for progress along the medical way. These eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City had only committed evil deeds and joined the scamming gang of Heaven Connect City because they were no longer able to progress due to their statuses and lack of resources. Now that they had found hope again, they turned over a new leaf to wholeheartedly pursue their medical studies.
Since Wang Zhen was from the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he was not influenced nor bound by the schools of medical thoughts of the Vast Thousand Domains, so his methods tended to be unorthodox. But if one paid closer attention and verified his methods, one would realize that there was sound logic behind them. The clashing and merging of the different medical ways of the Heaven Wasteland Domain and Vast Thousand Domains caused Wang Zhen's medical skills and knowledge to increase rapidly. Similarly, the few eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City felt as though a gate to a whole new world of knowledge lay before them and started to delve crazily into it.
Ye Qingyu noticed their change in attitude and was secretly pleased.
He did not expect the situation to turn out this way but could not deny that this was a good outcome for everybody in the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.
Only Great Dragon Turtle Demon's situation continued to show no signs of improving.
Ye Qingyu visited Great Dragon Turtle Demon every day and used Violet-Gold Dragon King Ginseng to support his life force. As he gradually regained his yuan qi, Ye Qingyu would inject a wisp of yuan qi, which contained traces of yellow Immortal qi, into Great Dragon Turtle Demon's body each day. Through trial and error, Ye Qingyu had discovered that the yellow divine qi seemed to complement the medicinal effects of the Violet-Gold Dragon King Ginseng. This was even more beneficial to Great Dragon Turtle Demon's body.
Wang Zhen and the few doctors from Heaven Connect City would check on Great Dragon Turtle Demon every day.
Wang Zhen would then record the results of their consultation in detail and submit this report to Ye Qingyu and Empress Yu Xiaoxing.
Ye Qingyu had started to study the ancient one hundred and eight characters carved onto the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and tried to guess the meaning behind them. Back then, Ye Qingyu had obtained his knowledge of elixir refinery from these formations and had stunned the Pill God and Medicine God of the empire with his knowledge. This meant that the one hundred and eight ancient characters contained the mysteries of the medical way.
He combined the consultation papers of Wang Zhen together with his knowledge gained from the one hundred and eight ancient characters and continued to refine his plans and methodologies as he continued to devise a way to save Great Dragon Turtle Demon.
Ye Qingyu was kept so busy that he basically did not ask about the situation in the foreign domain.
During this period, at long last, several sects and forces on the Road of Chaos started to knock on the doors of the Green Xuan Halland issued visiting notices as they rushed to call on the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.
The first sect to call on them was a sect led by the Human Race, known as the Shunchang Sect. They were not as big as the super forces in the myriad domains but they were rather well-respected amongst the emerging sects over the past thousand years.
They had come to visit as a gesture of goodwill.
The Shunchang Sect were always on bad terms with the Black Moon Immortal Palace and had fought many times with them for a long time. They were clearly abiding by the principle of "An enemy of an enemy is a friend" when they came to visit and hoped that they could be considered allies with the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.
Empress Yu Xiaoxing personally received the master of the Shunchang Sect.
Two hours later, many sects saw the Empress personally see off the master of the Shunchang Sect as he departed from the Green Xuan Hall, full of smiles. This news quickly spread like wildfire across Heaven Connect City.
Although they had only had a glimpse of the gracefulness and hospitality of the Empress, it answered many of their questions. The sects who had been quietly observing the situation and lived in fear of Ye Qingyu's terrifying reputation as a crazed killing god suddenly realized that the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps was not an exclusive and ignorant sect. The hospitality and grace extended to the Shunchang Sect showed that they were willing to cooperate and interact with the various races and forces across the Vast Thousand Domains.
Following the Shunchang Sect's example, many other forces started to call on the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps as well.
Thereafter, when the other sects received news of this, they also made their way to the Green Xuan Hall.
This also included several prominent ancient sects in the myriad domains.
There were upright sects and races who made their way to the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps because they were awestruck by Ye Qingyu's impressive talent. Other than wanting to catch a glimpse of Ye Qingyu, they also wanted to express their views on cooperation with the Heaven Wasteland Domain. They showed due respect to the diplomatic corps and were sincere in their intentions.
Obviously, not everyone harbored goodwill.
Several forces who visited bore malicious intentions. In the name of visiting a new domain, they came to deliver some kind of message or attempted to try to suss out if Ye Qingyu truly possessed precious treasures. They intended to use their visit to find fault with the Heaven Wasteland Domain, or deliver a message on behalf of the Black Moon Immortal Palace.
The Green Xuan Hall became unusually lively.
More and more representatives came to visit them, with no end in sight. It suddenly became trendy in Heaven Connect City for anyone, regardless of race or status, to call on the Green Xuan Hall. The experts from the major races and forces almost destroyed the threshold to the Green Xuan Hall in their rush to visit that place. Those who were not aware of the situation could not have been faulted for assuming that there was a grand gathering taking place in the hall.
However, the only thing that the visitors had in common was, regardless of the status of their sects or their motives for visiting, none of them managed to catch of glimpse of Ye Qingyu. Regardless of how prominent their force was or their motives for visiting, they were all received by Empress Yu Xiaoxing and several members of the diplomatic corps.
Empress Yu Xiaoxing displayed the gracefulness that befitted her rank as the Empress of the Human Race. She was always dignified throughout, and this caused many forces to understand that the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps was not just about that crazy punk Ye Qingyu but that it was also led by an incredibly gorgeous Empress. This was a good sign, for Yu Xiaoxing had displayed her talent and charm to the world, which greatly improved the image that everyone had of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. The perceptions that these foreign domains had about the Heaven Wasteland Domain started to become more fair and comprehensive. Positive stories and hearsay about the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps started to make their rounds around Heaven Connect City.
Time flew by.
Soon, it was the night of the seventh day.
Outside the quiet room—
As per his daily procedure, Luo Yi reported the recovery progress of the injured members of the diplomatic corps to Ye Qingyu, who was still in self-isolation.
After the report, the young guard dug out a bamboo slip filled with a list of names and said, "Sir, the Empress has recorded a list of names and the basic stats of the sects who have visited on this bamboo slip. This afternoon, a force known as the Heavenly Mandate Gate wanted to call on you. They mentioned that they have been suppressed by the Black Moon Immortal Palace for many years and want to join forces with the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps to expose their evil deeds. Also, an Enforcement Elder of the Crimson Divine Sect brought an entourage of more than a dozen disciples to the Green Xuan Hall and said that they would like to inquire about their ancestor…"
The past two nights, when Luo Yi came to the quiet room to report on various matters, he would also include a report on the visitors for the day as well as their origins and motives. This was something that Empress Yu Xiaoxing had specially tasked him to do. It did not take a lot of time or effort but was a clever way of keeping Ye Qingyu abreast of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps' current situation and others' perception of them.
After Luo Yi concluded his report, he gathered his booklet and respectfully said, "During your time of self-isolation, Elder Yan Wushuang visited once and brought news that in three days, there will be a meeting in the Alliance of Domains divine temple. They will finally be announcing the results of the test… You were in self-isolation so the Empress did not send anyone to inform you at once."
"In three days?" Ye Qingyu was surprised. This was sooner than he had imagined. He thought for a moment, then asked, "Did Elder Yan mention anything else?"
"Elder Yan said that in three days, there will be a council airship sent to bring the Empress and yourself to the Alliance of Domains divine temple and only the two of you will be allowed to enter. As for the rest of the diplomatic corps, they will have to patiently wait at the Green Xuan Hall for the results. The Empress also asked about the final outcome, but Elder Yan was not aware of the outcome either." Luo Yi briefly summarized everything that Yan Wushuang had said.
Ye Qingyu nodded.
The road had been arduous and tough, and now, they were finally about to know the outcome.
In three days?
Let's wait another three days then.
Chapter 841 - Wen Wan's Warning



Little Nine's words had alarmed the rest of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.

Did the retired emperor of the Dragonblood Dynasty possess such a demon-like talent?

Since he had once battled [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], did it mean that he was now powerful enough to defeat the Quasi-emperor?

"Now that you mention it, I've also made some inquiries about him." Wen Wan hesitated, then continued, "It's said that his talent is practically heaven-defying and he is the most outstanding talent that emerged from the Dragon-Human clan in close to six thousand  years. The blood that flows within his veins is the purest Dragon Race blood that has been seen in the past thousands of centuries. He reached the Peak Great Saint Realm five thousand  years ago and is said to be as powerful as the peerless Dragon-Human clan experts who perished in the 18th district thousands of centuries ago. There is also a rumor that he is the legitimate son of the Dragon-Human clan's ancestor."

Ximen Yeshui grew more excited and his eyes flashed. He continued, "It is also rumored that three thousand years ago, this retired emperor overthrew one hundred thirty-six sects single-handedly, of which fifty-eight sects were medium forces, ten were top forces, and two were super forces. In a single night, he slaughtered close to a hundred Saints and a Great Saint... Tsk, tsk, tsk. He is definitely a vicious and cruel character. To be honest, his combat strength sounds terrifying and I'm afraid that my master might only be fit to carry his sandals. Haha..."

Ximen Yeshui was probably the only person throughout the myriad domains who dared to speak of his master in such a manner behind his back.

Ye Qingyu was already accustomed to Ximen Yeshui's manner of speech and pretended to ignore his statement. He looked at Wen Wan and said, "Since he seems like such a formidable character and is almost invincible, why hasn't the Dragon-Human clan regained their former glory after all these years?"

According to his research, the Dragon-Human clan was one of the most ancient races of the myriad domains. With their long history and vast amounts of resources, they were once the indisputable overlords of the myriad domains in their glory days.

Unfortunately, thousands of centuries ago, their ancestor perished and their [Dragon Blood Halberd] was lost in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. Left without a leader, the Dragon-Human clan naturally started to decline.

Over time, as other races started to grow stronger, the Dragon-Human clan gradually started to decline and maintained a low profile.

"Now that you mention it... with the exception of the retired emperor, the rest of the Dragon-Human clan is very ordinary. As the saying goes, each one is worse than the last. It would be extremely rare for the later generations to produce a genius. One tree does not make up a forest and it would be impossible for the retired emperor alone to salvage the situation. He has given his all these past few years to the Dragonblood Dynasty, and a sage once surmised that if this retired emperor had not been distracted by his temporal and worldly desires and devoted too much energy to the Dragonblood Dynasty, he might have already stepped on the emperor's road by this time." Wen Wan heaved a soft sigh, then looked at Ye Qingyu. He looked as though he was about to speak, but ultimately swallowed his words, seeming slightly emotional.

Indeed, one could not help but feel for an expert who was almost at the pinnacle of the martial way whose progress on the martial way had been halted because of the ties to his race and was now unable to make further breakthroughs.

Ye Qingyu was slightly shaken by Wen Wan's words, for he understood the look in Wen Wan's eyes and also understood what he meant by that sigh.

Ye Qingyu's own predicament was extremely similar to that of the retired emperor of the Dragon-Human clan. In the same way that this demon-like talent of the Dragon-Human clan had to support the entire Dragonblood Dynasty, Ye Qingyu himself now had to support the entire Heaven Wasteland Dynasty. To be more precise, the sudden rise of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps on the Road of Chaos was because of the single-handed efforts of Ye Qingyu. With the exception of Ye Qingyu, few amongst the Heaven Wasteland Domain could be considered experts. Even a talent such as Yan Buhui, who was highly regarded in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, would not amount to much here in the Vast Thousand Domains.

If the talents of the Heaven Wasteland Domain were unable to mature fast enough to share Ye Qingyu's burden, as time passed, Ye Qingyu would probably also have to devote his energies to the matters of the Heaven Wasteland Domain. This would definitely hinder his progress on the martial way.

Ye Qingyu could not say anything to relieve Wen Wan's worries.

Now that he was entrenched so deeply within the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he could no longer break free.

One would have to compromise in this world.

"No matter what happens, there is no need to concern yourselves with this matter of the Dragonblood Dynasty," Ye Qingyu said resolutely. He did not reveal much but instead, changed the topic. "We will need to closely monitor what others are saying in Heaven Connect City. Pay close attention to who makes the most vicious accusations and report their names to me. I'd like to see who is aiding the Black Moon Immortal Palace in an attempt to bring us down."

The murderous spirit was clear in his message.

Ye Qingyu's words put everyone's minds at ease.

No one was sure when it had started, but everyone within the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had already placed blind faith and trust in Ye Qingyu. Regardless of how serious the situation might seem, as long as Ye Qingyu said that there was no problem, it was as though everything would truly be alright.

Then, everyone started to relax and feel more reassured.

They talked for another two hours and finally dispersed after the Empress assigned tasks to all of them.

Ye Qingyu returned to the quiet room to continue his self-isolation.

According to the news that Wen Wan and the others had brought back, the situation in the foreign domain, as well as the ultimate expert of the Dragon-Human clan who was on his way here, things were not looking good for the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. Ye Qingyu was still confident but he did not dare to let down his guard.

Most importantly, he had to make full use of the time he had to regain his strength.

Ye Qingyu spent the next few days immersed in cultivating. When he was not cultivating, he went to the western yard to check on the injured members of the diplomatic corps and see how they were recuperating.

Time flew by.

Three to five days went by in the blink of an eye.

After he had subdued those doctors of Heaven Connect City with his thunderous methods the last time, the injured were recovering at a much faster pace and he no longer had to spend vast amounts of resources and money. Wang Zhen also had the other doctors firmly under his thumb. Furthermore, after hungrily absorbing the medical theories and medical way of the Vast Thousand Domains, his vast knowledge enabled him to comprehend new things through analogies. He proposed many alchemical techniques and prescriptions that had dumbfounded the so-called doctors of Heaven Connect City. In a few days, Wang Zhen had fully unveiled his extraordinary talent and skills in the medical way.

Awed by Wang Zhen's talent, the eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City had fully submitted to him and were very cooperative. They had even consulted with Wang Zhen on several issues and engaged him in their discussions. Although they had initially submitted to Ye Qingyu due to fear, their attitudes had changed because of their respect and awe for Wang Zhen.

Just as martial artists continually aimed for progress along the martial way, every doctor would naturally pursue and long for progress along the medical way. These eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City had only committed evil deeds and joined the scamming gang of Heaven Connect City because they were no longer able to progress due to their statuses and lack of resources. Now that they had found hope again, they turned over a new leaf to wholeheartedly pursue their medical studies.

Since Wang Zhen was from the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he was not influenced nor bound by the schools of medical thoughts of the Vast Thousand Domains, so his methods tended to be unorthodox. But if one paid closer attention and verified his methods, one would realize that there was sound logic behind them. The clashing and merging of the different medical ways of the Heaven Wasteland Domain and Vast Thousand Domains caused Wang Zhen's medical skills and knowledge to increase rapidly. Similarly, the few eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City felt as though a gate to a whole new world of knowledge lay before them and started to delve crazily into it.

Ye Qingyu noticed their change in attitude and was secretly pleased.

He did not expect the situation to turn out this way but could not deny that this was a good outcome for everybody in the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.

Only Great Dragon Turtle Demon's situation continued to show no signs of improving.

Ye Qingyu visited Great Dragon Turtle Demon every day and used Violet-Gold Dragon King Ginseng to support his life force. As he gradually regained his yuan qi, Ye Qingyu would inject a wisp of yuan qi, which contained traces of yellow Immortal qi, into Great Dragon Turtle Demon's body each day. Through trial and error, Ye Qingyu had discovered that the yellow divine qi seemed to complement the medicinal effects of the Violet-Gold Dragon King Ginseng. This was even more beneficial to Great Dragon Turtle Demon's body.

Wang Zhen and the few doctors from Heaven Connect City would check on Great Dragon Turtle Demon every day.

Wang Zhen would then record the results of their consultation in detail and submit this report to Ye Qingyu and Empress Yu Xiaoxing.

Ye Qingyu had started to study the ancient one hundred and eight characters carved onto the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and tried to guess the meaning behind them. Back then, Ye Qingyu had obtained his knowledge of elixir refinery from these formations and had stunned the Pill God and Medicine God of the empire with his knowledge. This meant that the one hundred and eight ancient characters contained the mysteries of the medical way.

He combined the consultation papers of Wang Zhen together with his knowledge gained from the one hundred and eight ancient characters and continued to refine his plans and methodologies as he continued to devise a way to save Great Dragon Turtle Demon.

Ye Qingyu was kept so busy that he basically did not ask about the situation in the foreign domain.

During this period, at long last, several sects and forces on the Road of Chaos started to knock on the doors of the Green Xuan Halland issued visiting notices as they rushed to call on the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.

The first sect to call on them was a sect led by the Human Race, known as the Shunchang Sect. They were not as big as the super forces in the myriad domains but they were rather well-respected amongst the emerging sects over the past thousand years.

They had come to visit as a gesture of goodwill.

The Shunchang Sect were always on bad terms with the Black Moon Immortal Palace and had fought many times with them for a long time. They were clearly abiding by the principle of "An enemy of an enemy is a friend" when they came to visit and hoped that they could be considered allies with the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.

Empress Yu Xiaoxing personally received the master of the Shunchang Sect.

Two hours later, many sects saw the Empress personally see off the master of the Shunchang Sect as he departed from the Green Xuan Hall, full of smiles. This news quickly spread like wildfire across Heaven Connect City.
