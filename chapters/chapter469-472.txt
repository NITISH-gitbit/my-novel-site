Chapter 469:


Chapter 489, Regaining consciousness

In the early years, because of the strength of the empire, some ordinary sects basically could not set off any large waves, but the Three Sects and Three Schools still had some considerable power among the martial arts circle of the Human Race.

Back then in Youyan Pass, the disciples of the Crepe Myrtle Sect, Violet sSeven Stars Sect as well as the Tiger Dragon School of the Three Sects and Three Schools, were incredibly arrogant because of their background.

But this time in the war of the Light City, the strength of the Three Sects and Three Schools——and even the power of the various sects within the territory of the empire, were calculated. Not only did they massacre one another, it could even be said that their hundred years of foundation was uprooted.

Finally, besides the few sect experts loyal to Left Minister and old Marshal Li Guangbi, that had resisted the so-called temptation of the treasury of the [Light Palace], and did not enter the Earth Fire spirit spring sword pit, in order to bypass the killing formation, all the other sects suffered a disastrous loss. Some sects were completely destroyed, from the elders to the final generation of disciples. Not one person survived.

The sects that had suffered a calamity a hundred years ago because of the rise of the Snow Empire were once again, through this plan, critically wounded and weakened.

As a result, sects would never have the power to contend with the Snow Empire.

In the past one month, the Snow Emperor was still living in seclusion. Old Commander Li Guangbi, under the advice of Yu Junhan, led an army of elite troops to plough through and tidy up the major sects once more.

For sects that did not obey, their main gate was breached and completely eradicated.

In this regard, Li Guangbi did not have the slightest mercy.

Because he knew the intention of Yu Junhan.

The central Domain Gate would open soon. Whether this was a blessing or a curse, before the foreign forces really came pouring in, they had to first of all completely eliminate the instability within the Snow Empire. This was to prevent the sects that were unwilling to give up their past glory from colluding with forces of foreign domains. The disaster would be even greater at that time.

This process, for these sects, was also tragic.

The Violet Seven Stars Sect was completely destroyed, the armoury of the sect was emptied, the four supreme elders were killed, the leader of the sect was captured, the disciples that were above the Spirit spring realm were assigned to the army, and those below the Spirit spring realm were all dismissed...

The Violet Seven Stars Sect that had several hundred years of history was severed like that.

The Crepe Myrtle Sect’s case was slightly better.

Because they had timely surrendered, the Crepe Myrtle Sect was not annihilated, but the main experts of the sect were also enlisted into the army, and some elders and trusted aides who had authority before were replaced, while the head of the clan was detained.

Divine General Gong of the Five Great Divine Generals of the [Light Palace], Gao Diping personally oversaw everything. The military of the empire had the final say in the important matters of the Crepe Myrtle Sect, including the choice of the candidate for the new head of the sect.

In addition to these two large sects, the other few large sects also were not able to escape.

The dragon sub-sect of the Dragon Tiger Sect chose to surrender, while the Tiger sub-sect chose to flee. The major experts and masters of the Tiger sub-sect fled overnight, and only a few people remained behind, accepting the imperial military takeover...

But those people of the Tiger sub-sect that fled also did not really evade the military. Ten days later, the head of the Tiger Sect Zhao Jin was killed in the territory of the White Mountain Black Waters, and the Tiger sub-sect was declared completely destroyed.

Of the Three Sects and Three Schools, only Matchless Blade City was respected by the Imperial army. Li Guangbi personally visited the Divine Blade Palace of the Matchless Blade City and met with Qin Zhishui who had just become the City Lord. Soon after the Matchless Blade City declared to the outside world that they surrendered and pledged allegiance to the empire, and became a special military ministry of the empire.

Without stopping for a rest, Lu Guangbi rectified the Jianghu sects within the empire’s territory, completely rewriting the martial artist circle that had been in disorder for nearly a hundred years...

And some of the ancient sects and forces that hid behind the Three Sects and Three Schools were also affected.

At the same time, Right Minister, Yu Feiyan and Left Minister began a huge cleaning in the Imperial capital.

Within a hundred miles of the [Light Palace], all people were moved away, regardless of whether they were nobles or civilians, no delay was allowed.

There was a man from an aristocratic family that took advantage of the fact that he was acquainted with the Right Minister and friends with the little young master Du of the Du household. He was not only arrogant but wounded several empire officials who came to urge him to move. He also threatened that he was not moving, and there was nothing they could do...

After an hour, his head was hung directly on the announcement pillar within the relocation area.

The other large and small noble families immediately knew that this time the empire was serious. The Right Minister who was usually very protective of his subordinates also showed no trace of politeness.

After this, the nobles no longer dared to fight back.

This relocation, however, was not a barbarous operation, and the empire had compiled a list of names and amount of money as compensation. Both nobles and ordinary people would receive relatively good compensation, particularly ordinary people. After relocation, they would be given residence and better compensation and treatment than before.

Once this matter was spread, the people that lived outside of the relocation region, were jealous.

The empire machines were operated in a strict and orderly manner, its power and efficiency were undoubtedly shown.

The entire relocation process probably took less than 20 days.

The military even sent out airships, patrolling the skies and helping people to move.

At the same time, the vacated area had become a restricted area, and no one was allowed to enter.

A large number of imperial troops were stationed there.

Countless military projects were built as fast as possible, and rune formations containing terrifying and boundless energy were set up in the first moments. All sorts of resources were endlessly transported to the relocation area.

It was just a sight that some curious people only saw on the surface.

The scene that they were unaware of was that countless military elites and experts were transferred from the frontier and main battle corps, and were quietly stationed in the area within several hundreds miles of Light City.

As time went by.

The storm of chaos swirling vortex in the sky over the Imperial capital had gradually slowed down again, and the gloomy fog was gradually dissipating.

People could finally see the blue sky.

When the sun pierced through the faint clouds, illuminating below, and the warm rays of light once again shone onto everyone’s body, many people’s hearts that had been hanging in the air since the beginning of the battle of Light City finally returned to their chest.

Like a very long dream, it made many people sigh.

Everything seemed to have returned to its original appearance.

In addition to the several hundred miles within Light city, in the other areas of the Imperial capital, there was already a stream of people, horses and carriages on the streets. Stores that have been closed for more than one month could not wait to open up to do business again...

Only Right Minister Lin Zheng and the other people who knew the truth understood that the disaster probably had not passed by yet, and on the contrary, may have just begun.

Evacuating people in the area within a hundred of miles of the Light City, building various defensive structures, dispatching troops, setting down rune formations, and dispatching powerful elite experts of the empire were all in order to guard against potential invading forces after the opening of the central Domain Gate.

And the reason that there were only defensive arrangements within hundred of miles of the [Light Palace] and the entire Imperial capital was not evacuated was because the operation was too large. But also because within this hundred miles, the empire’s most powerful forces and military power had already gathered. If they were unable to withstand the forces of foreign domains, then the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain would be caught in a long, bitter disaster. Even if they Imperial capital was evacuated, it would be pointless.

The real core people of the officials of the empire, during this time, were working non-stop.

Many decrees were issued from the two minister residences.

Some people that do not know about the situation were surprised to find that, in this period of time, the decrees issued from the Left Minister and Right Minister residences were unexpectedly unanimous and coordinated. It was completely different from what they had seen over the past decades.

With the passage of time, more and more people gradually felt that, after the sun was visible again, the atmosphere over the empire seemed to have become extremely tense and unfamiliar.

……

Two months after the war over Light City.

Early morning.

It was the coldest time in winter.

The fire forest of the fourth region of Light City was replanted. Fire trees, which had almost withered, were nourished with the flames and yuan qi of the Earth Fire spirit spring sword pit and became full of vitality again.

But this forest was still sparse, and could not be compared to before, when the tree leaves were blazing like an ocean.

With the support of Jin Ling’er, Ye Qingyu slowly took a walk in the fire forest, stretching his body and breathing the fresh air.

Ye Qingyu had regained consciousness two days ago.

This news was kept a secret for the time being, and only Yu Junhan and a few other people knew.

Ever since Ye Qingyu had awakened, Yu Junhan smiled a lot more.

She examined the condition of Ye Qingyu’s body twice a day, and was gradually feeling much more reassured.

Ye Qingyu’s recovery was much better than expected, his memory was undamaged, his soul was complete, but his mind and power seemed to have weakened by several times. He was now around the same level as a one or two Spirit spring martial artist.

Also, the yuan qi within his body had not fully recovered, it was less than 1% of his former normal state.

It should be said that Ye Qingyu, who had just regained consciousness, was in a strange weak state, his fighting strength was no different to experts of the ordinary Spirit spring realm.

Adding to this, since this body was regenerated from the blood and yuan qi of Yu Junhan, Ye Qingyu was unable to completely control his body, and at the beginning he couldn’t even walk smoothly.

Besides taking care of Ye Qingyu, Yu Junhan also needed to help Right Minister and the others.

Although they have reunited, but there was not enough time in one day. After all, when the nest is overturned, no egg stays unbroken. The current situation was too urgent, only after she gets through this could she protect Ye Qingyu better.

And Ye Qingyu himself, after regaining consciousness, from Jin Ling’er, Bai Yuanxing, Wen Wan, and other people, found out about what had happened after he sustained serious injury and lost consciousness——

========================================

Chapter 470:


The truth made Ye Qingyu incomparably shocked.
He did not imagine that behind the battle of the [Light Palace], there were so many hidden stories.
To think that the Right Minister had always played a role in these years. To think that the old man, the person he had always regarded as the greatest calamity of the Empire, was the greatest hero in the Empire that had always endured and hidden himself.
The Apex Prince Yu Feiyan that had always seemed wildly ambitious was also like so.
It also could not be imagined that Song Xiaojun had stood on the side of the Empire. In the battle at the Pinnacle of the Ninth Heaven, she had cooperated with Divine General Gong, Wen Wan and Ximen Yeshui and the others, to absolutely kill the Poison Ancestor as well as the heart demon...
The battlefield of the Pinnacle of the Ninth Heaven was vast and boundless. Normally speaking, if different experts entered into this battlefield, they would be thousands of miles away. If they did not have any markings on each other at all, it would be very hard to find the other party. Those experts who had arranged to battle would leave a mark on each other, so that they could instantly enter into the same area.
It seemed like Song Xiaojun had, with Gao Diping, Wen Wan and the others, a prior arrangement. They had left a marking behind, and they could activate it hiddenly, hence they had achieved such a beautifully coordinated extermination.
As to just how vicious and acute the battle of the Ninth Heaven was, Ye Qingyu did not need to think too deeply to guess at it.
After all, they were experts at the Heaven Ascension stage trying to kill each other.
What made Ye Qingyu curious was, just what sort of methods did the Right Minister use, that could cause Song Xiaojun to willingly help Snow Empire.
What made Ye Qingyu equally shocked was that after he was struck by that bolt of heavenly lightning, and had nearly turned to ashes with his soul scattered in pieces, the silly dog Little Nine had really swallowed three bolts of such Heavenly Lightning?
It was three bolts of Heavenly Lightning that originated from Heaven’s punishment, three entire bolts.
For such divine lightning, to only be able to break open the mouth of this fellow. There were even parts of his fur that had not even turned completely black. It seemed like he had only gone to sleep for a month of so, and right now the majority of his injuries had already recovered.
To think that he was not as great as a dog?
Ye Qingyu did not know how to feel in his heart.
But returning to the topic, just what was the background of this silly white dog? Ye Qingyu was not even clear of this, even now. To be able to use body techniques to avoid the strike of Heavenly Lightning, if he was able to grow up and mature, it must be that he would grow up to be an amazing battle companion, right?
There were some expectations in Ye Qingyu's heart.
Furthermore, he seemed to have faintly discovered that some sort of transformation had happened in the body of Little Nine after he had ingested several bolts of Divine Lightning. His originally white fur, if one carefully inspected, one would discover a faint layer of gold in it.
This type of colour was exactly the same as the colour of that bolt of Heavenly Lightning.
Considering that Little Nine was still slumbering, and disturbing him would have some sort of negative impact on him, Ye Qingyu quickly extinguished the urge to question him clearly.
But, out of all the matters, the thing that caused Ye Qingyu the most shock and disbelief was that Yu Junhan... that Aunt Han, was his own mother?
This... just how did this happen?
Ye Qingyu had no way of believing everything.
He could still clearly remember the memories he had when he was small, as well as what his parents had looked like. In his memories, his recollection of just what sort of a person his mother was could not be any clearer. How was it possible that Yu Junhan would be his own mother?
Until today, Ye Qingyu had not had a long conversation with Yu Junhan.
And Yu Junhan also seemed to intentionally avoid this question.
She came every day to take care of Ye Qingyu's every needs, but did not make Ye Qingyu really call her 'mother' and did not display any intention of seeming to do so.
This caused Ye Qingyu to be somewhat distressed.
But what made him even more distressed was the current state of his body.
Because he knew the reason why he was currently so weak.
"It seems like the complexion of Master today is much better," Jin Ling'er said with a grin.
In these days, this little kid had been completely scared witless by Ye Qingyu's state. He could not even eat peacefully, guarding at the entrance of the [Light Palace]. After Ye Qingyu had awakened, he was determined to protect Ye Qingyu beside him, not willing to leave for any reason.
Therefore in these two days, it was Jin Ling'er who took care of Ye Qingyu.
The several female servants that Lin Zheng had sent over had all been sent away.
Ye Qingyu breathed in a breath of cold air, and laughingly scolded, "You little brat, staying beside me every day, your lazing about and not cultivating."
Jin Ling'er laughed, but no matter what he said, he would not leave.
Ye Qingyu let him do as he pleased.
He lifted his head to look at the fire trees that were red like flames, and there was only the faint warmth of the winter sunlight landing on his body. Ye Qingyu's thoughts could not help but return to the instant when his fleshly body had forcibly endured a bolt of Heavenly Lighting.
At that moment, when the golden lightning struck him, Ye Qingyu felt that the entire world had suddenly frozen at that moment in time.
In that spark of a moment, he lost all hearing, touch, vision, taste...
All his five senses had disappeared.
Such a sensation was absolutely the clearest experience one could have on death suddenly descending on himself.
Ye Qingyu felt that he had fallen in an endless abyss of darkness, which continued to fall and fall, never ever reaching the ground.
At that moment, Ye Qingyu thought he was dead for sure.
But very quickly, there was another sound that appeared on his brain.
Dong!
Clear and vast.
Such a sound seemed as if it had directly sounded out from Ye Qingyu's not yet departed soul, containing a mysterious and enormous power.
Under such a vibration, power rippled through his body. It made Ye Qingyu slowly be able to sense the sensation of living.
Dong!
Dong!Dong!Dong!
This mysterious noise of the bell was not fast or slow. It continuously let out sound after sound.
The noise of the bell was like saintly light. It constantly washed over Ye Qingyu who was drifting and also allowed his five sense that had already been cut off, to recover.
He could faintly see that the noise of the bell had emitted from the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
At that time, Ye Qingyu had not made clear just where he was. What he could see at that time was just chaotic storms that were throughout the skies, as if he was being brought back into the time where the world was being born from chaos.
The clear and the light, the turbid and inelegance, was entangled everywhere all around.
He was amidst chaos. He could see the [Cloud Top Cauldron] rotating high up in the skies, the bronze light flickering. He could see shreds of yellow mist after yellow mist, like a weeping willow, dropping down from within the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. It protected his body within it...
Then what followed after that, as the chaos was made clear, was that these faint yellow mist placed Ye Qingyu's body into the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
Within the cauldron, there was suddenly great light.
Ye Qingyu spent a great deal of time before he was finally able to get used to such a piercing golden light. He could faintly see as if he could discern the surroundings.
The interior of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] was massive.
It was like an incomparable and vast golden palace.
And on the walls of this golden palace, there were all sorts of engravings and carvings. There were some that were enwrapped in chaos that could not be seen clearly, and there were some images that only claws and scales could be see in it. This were images of the first ancestral humans hunting and sacrificing their prey to the heavens in their prayers. There were some that could be discerned extremely clearly, and what it drew was Fiendgods patrolling all around, keeping an eye on the world...
All these scenes were vivid and lifelike.
Ye Qingyu looked at it, then felt his vision blurring, and a spell of dizziness hit him. The strength of his soul and consciousness had no way of withstanding the profoundness of this scene. Forcefully seeing it, he felt tears hitting his eyes, his vision blurring.
Apart from these scenes, there were huge characters as well as formation inscriptions.
Ye Qingyu was like an ant. He was standing in the interior of a palace that was incomparably massive, that was unknown just how tall or wide it was.
Even just a wall, you would not be able to see the top of it if you looked up nor the bottom if you looked down. Just a brush stroke, or even a single character on this wall, was much larger than Ye Qingyu's body.
He had never imagined that there would be such a strange space within the interior of the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
Previously, he had been captured by Liu Yuancheng and had been stuffed inside the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to be refined. He had once seen the inside of this cauldron.
But at that time, Liu Yuancheng had completely wasted the treasure in his hands. Therefore, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] was still in a slumbering state, and he could not even use a tiny fraction of its power. When Ye Qingyu was inside, he could only see some little scenes, as well as those ancient characters...
Bur right now, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] was receiving the nourishment from the Spirit springs in Ye Qingyu's dantian, as well as being activated by the golden Heavenly Lightning. The interior space of it had unfolded, and there seemed to be an even more vast and mighty scene being unveiled.
Could this be the true essence of the [Cloud Top Cauldron]?
Ye Qingyu's heart, was attracted by the scenes depicted on the golden walls of the cauldron. He looked at every image, some were able to be discerned clearly while others were only murky pictures. Every time he looked at a scene, he felt that his spirit was being cleaned by an invisible energy...
Time was long, long as if there was no end.
After his most initial shock, Ye Qingyu's consciousness finally recovered a little. Thinking that there was a battle that was currently being held outside the [Light Palace], his heart began to become worried. He began anxiously wanted to depart.
But the vastness of the cauldron was like it was the universe, without limits and without end. Ye Qingyu searched everywhere, like a flickering shadow, but could not find an exit.
Ye Qingyu did not know how long he searched for, but he could utterly not find a way out.
He had already no way of confirming just what sort of state was he in. Was he alive, or was he dead?
In his memories, he had evidently been killed by the Heavenly Punishment.
Time was so long that to the later stages, Ye Qingyu did not know just how long had passed
Since he could not go out, his focus once again returned to the walls of the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
He was like a wandering spirit. Within the space of the massive [Cloud Top Cauldron], he spent just how many days drifting about aimlessly, looking at countless images on the walls...
It was long, like he had spent several lifetimes.
Ye Qingyu could already confirm that he was trapped inside.
Long like several aeons.
Just when he had abandoned any thought of escaping, the sound of the bell of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] once again emitted. This time, the sound had an attracting force that constantly pulled him upwards...
Then, Ye Qingyu awakened.
More accurately, the Ye Qingyu that was lying on the cold jade stone bed in the [Light Palace], awakened----
The truth made Ye Qingyu incomparably shocked.
He did not imagine that behind the battle of the [Light Palace], there were so many hidden stories.
To think that the Right Minister had always played a role in these years. To think that the old man, the person he had always regarded as the greatest calamity of the Empire, was the greatest hero in the Empire that had always endured and hidden himself.

Chapter 471:


The moment when he opened his eyes, Ye Qingyu instantly realized that he had departed from the vast endless and boundless space of the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
The things that his eyes saw was the true, real world.
But the next moment, he was able to sense a strange sensation that he had never experienced before from his own body.  No matter whether it was his limbs or his body, his head or his fingers, even his eyelids, there was a weariness and weakness that could not be controlled...
It was as if this body did not belong to he himself.
He lay on the cold jade stone bed for an hour before he could move his body, and slowly sit up.
Jin Ling'er who had stood at the door of the [Light Palace] was the first person to discover that Ye Qingyu had awakened.
All the people of the City of Light began to grow excited.
Yu Junhan rushed here.
Lin Zheng, Yu Xiaoheng, Yu Feiyan and the others also hurried here.
Amidst the excited cheers and yells of everyone, Ye Qingyu had gradually gotten used to his own body.
He also discovered that there was some change that had occurred within his body.
Two days had passed by in just a flash. Ye Qingyu finally knew what had happened after he had suffered the tribulation of thunder and lightning.
Under the fire tree, and faintly moving his body, Ye Qingyu began to think about what he should do after this.
Especially when Yu Junhan did not open her mouth. He entirely did not know just how he should broach the subject, and make clear on the matter of his origins and background.
This was an extremely strange feeling. He wanted to know the truth, but at the same time wanted to avoid it. This made Ye Qingyu even more conflicted than confessing to a girl he liked.
Thinking it over, Ye Qingyu felt that perhaps he could lay this matter aside for now.
There was timid emotion in his heart.
Apart from this, there was also Song Xiaojun and Yu Xiaoxing...
Ye Qingyu was not an idiot. Ever since Wen Wan had hinted at what had happened between Song Xiaojun and Yu Xiaoxing, he understood something.
As a man...
En, Demon King Ye finally felt that he was a man. To be able to make two exceptional girls such as them like him, the vanity that was deep within his heart was satisfied slightly.
But in truth, what Ye Qingyu was more concerned about was whether the memories of Song Xiaojun had recovered or not.
As for Yu Xiaoxing...
"Could it be between girls with the character 'Xiao', it is easy for them to have feelings towards me?"
Ye Qingyu cursed at himself in his heart.
Although he had faced Yu Xiaoxing several times after he awakened, and Ye Qingyu was calm on the outside, but the atmosphere was also somewhat strange.
Thankfully, the Yu Xiaoxing who was the 'Crown Prince' was also very busy in these days. In a day, she had less than half an hour's time to come see Ye Qingyu.
Of course, he also needed to think of a way to recover his strength.
"My soul and consciousness are not even a hundredth part of what it was in the past. It's because a part of my soul was being imprisoned within the [Cloud Top Couldron] that I was able to awaken, and that I can even enter the interior of the [Cloud Top Cauldron]!"
Ye Qingyu was very clear on the reason why his soul was so fragile right now.
After suffering Heavenly Punishment, because of some sort of reason, his soul was protected by the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. The little silver dragon had managed to preserve a shred of his life force behind, and afterwards Yu Junhan used her blood essence and yuan qi essence, to aid him to restoring his body. Furthermore, the secret techniques of the [Light Palace] had called his slumbering soul to awaken...
But Ye Qingyu knew that a part of his soul was still trapped within the [Cloud Top Cauldron], with no way to escape.
In these two days of time, Ye Qingyu had tried many times, but had no way of entirely attracting the soul out of the [cloud Top Cauldron].
Since his soul was not complete, it naturally caused his inner yuan to be like an underground volcano. It could not explode, it could only gather strength, gradually growing.
Right now, this was the reason Ye Qingyu could not entirely use his yuan qi cultivation.
Right now, in terms of yuan qi cultivation, his strength was not even comparable to a martial expert at the peak of the five Spirit springs stage.
But, conversely...
"The power of my fleshly body did not descend but rapidly shot up. Although I have not entirely gotten used to it, but I am sure that it can be comparable to experts at the early Heaven Ascension stage."
Ye Qingyu moved his palms, feeling an endless and limitless power flowing between his bones and flesh.
Perhaps it was because Yu Junhan used her own blood essence to treat Ye Qingyu's injuries. The end result was that the power of this blood essence had completely immersed in Ye Qingyu's body shred by shred.
Ye Qingyu already had no way of guessing just how high Yu Junhan's cultivation was.
But he could be sure that in a drop of her blood essence, the energy it contained could be compared with the full power strike of a Heaven Ascension stage expert at the early stages. It was unknown just how many droplets of blood essence Ye Qingyu had received from her. Therefore, the energy he received was naturally like a vast ocean.
If Yu Junhan was really his own mother, then using his mother's blood to restore his body was tantamount to Ye Qingyu's body being reborn once again.
In the martial realm, such a fortuitous encounter was really too rare.
This was equal to changing one's fate and destiny, changing one's natural body after being born.
If there were any imperfections previously in Ye Qingyu's body, after this process of being reborn, along with the peerless blood essence of Yu Junhan, as well as the vast power of the [Light Palace], Ye Qingyu's fleshly body had nearly turned into a perfect substance.
This was an incomparable body type.
Of course, these were all just Ye Qingyu's guesses. It still needed time to test and experiment.
Indicating for Jin Ling'er to stand by the side, Ye Qingyu faintly moved. He warmed up slightly, then his aura changed. Move by move began to be exhibited.
What he used was what Wen Wan had taught him in the first lesson during White Deer Academy. These were arts of body refinement, the [Snake Stance] of the [Eight Divine Stances].
With Ye Qingyu's current martial understanding, to exhibit such a basic body refinement technique, every move was like an immortal dancing under the moon, as if he was one with nature.
"Golden snake traverse the land!"
Ye Qingyu loudly shouted.
His body was extremely coordinated. Every muscle on his body was like a golden snake crawling, slowly moving and twirling. From top to bottom, there was a sense of beauty that was hard to describe filling him.
Pa!Pa!Pa!
Light sounds constantly emitted from the bone marrow within various parts of Ye Qingyu's body.
It was like a rusted piece of machinery that was beginning to move once again. Only then would such noise be produced.
A short while later.
Ye Qingyu had completely finished the moves of the [Snake Stance].
A gentle warmth was moving about his limbs and body. It was enough to make him clearly feel that his ability to control his own body was slowly returning.
The moves changed.
Ye Qingyu began to train in the [Tiger Stance].
There were roars of tigers that constantly exploded out from within Ye Qingyu's body.
Training till he was intoxicated, the skeleton within Ye Qingyu's body supported his body and propped his muscles out, as if there was a mighty tiger rumbling around within his body. It was currently refining and training his tendons as well as muscles.
In the next two hours, Ye Qingyu completely demonstrated and practiced all the moves of the [Eight Divine Stances].
When the last move was finsihed, Ye Qingyu stood where he was, his aura calm.
He was already able to utterly control this body.
The him at this time was deep like an abyss, his body unmoving. It was like he was an ancient divine mountain, giving someone a sensation wherein they could not stare upon him. It was as if even though heaven collapsed and the earth broke, it would not even affect Ye Qingyu slightly.
"Master, your strength... it's recovered?"
Jin Ling'er  let out a delighted gasp by the side.
From his perspective, after Ye Qingyu had completely done all the moves of the [Eight Divine Stances], his heavy and sharp aura had once again returned to him. There was perhaps even more pressure than in the past. This little fellow by the side nearly could not breathe due to such heavy pressure.
There was a faint smile that appeared on Ye Qingyu's lips. Shaking his head, "There's only some small gains. My yuan qi is still not completely recovered..."
"Oh..." Hearing this, Jin Ling'er was somewhat disappointed. But then he instantly pretended to be incomparably excited, "Master. you are so amazing. You will definitely quickly recover. Don't force yourself."
Ye Qingyu laughed loudly.
"You little fellow, you are thinking of consoling me? Don't worry, your master has experienced many life and death events ever since rising from Deer City. How could I grow impatient and flustered by such a temporary problem?"
Jin Ling'er laughingly stuck his tongue out.
"Go cultivate, there's no need to accompany me. " Ye Qingyu waved his hands. "As the saying goes, the song does not leave one's mouth, and a fist cannot leave one's hand. A martial experts cultivation is going against the flow, if you do not advance you will fall. You have already wasted significant amounts of time by accompanying me."
Seeing that Ye Qingyu's strength had recovered significantly, and his situation had stabilized, he could finally rest assured. Obediently following instructions, he turned and left.
Ye Qingyu smiled.
His little disciple, although he liked to play around, but he knew how to deal with sudden changes in emotions. He was after all a child that came from a poor background, and had a pure heart. His efforts in raising him was not wasted.
Slowly sensing the changes occurring within his own body, Ye Qingyu returned to the [Light Palace].
"The blood essence that Aunt Han left behind in my body, half of it was used for my fleshy body to recover. A little bit of it was refined into the training just now. But the large part of it still existed within my bones. But if I am able to completely refine all of it, then the power of my fleshly body would be enough to shake the heavens!" “
Sitting in a meditative position on the cold jade stone chair, Ye Qingyu was already exceedingly clear about his own state.
After all, the [Eight Divine Stances] was only a basic body refining technique. After using it completely once, Ye Qingyu knew that it no longer had much benefit in helping him refine the hidden energy within his own body.
As he thought of this, he began activating the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].
The [True Will of the Sky Dragon] belonged to the category of one's martial will. It had no relations to the power of one's soul or spirit, but rather the determination and will of a martial artist. Even with Ye Qingyu's current situation, he could easily use it.
This type of martial will was truly the ultimate body refining technique.
Ye Qingyu decided to use the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] to refine his body, and to completely refine the hiding potential energy within his body. Since he had no way of solving the problem with his inner yuan, first increasing the power of his fleshly body was also a decent option.
In the next tens of days, Ye Qingyu utilized the time well to quickly refine the hidden energy in his body.
Of  course, he would also take some time out everyday to see everyone.
He would also give advice to the martial cultivation of Bai Yuanxing and the others.
Half a month later, within the Earth Fire sword pit, there was a strange change that occurred. The chaotic storm vortex within the skies completely disappeared. An ancient stone doorway and gate began to appear within the air, being born into the world.
The most central Domain Gate was finally completely opened---
The moment when he opened his eyes, Ye Qingyu instantly realized that he had departed from the vast endless and boundless space of the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
The things that his eyes saw was the true, real world.
But the next moment, he was able to sense a strange sensation that he had never experienced before from his own body.  No matter whether it was his limbs or his body, his head or his fingers, even his eyelids, there was a weariness and weakness that could not be controlled...
It was as if this body did not belong to he himself.
He lay on the cold jade stone bed for an hour before he could move his body, and slowly sit up.

========================================

Chapter 472:


The Central Domain Gate was an incomparably large stone gate.
No one could be sure on the details of this stone gate. There were many people that could prove just what sort of material it was made from. It was pale white, and was like stone and like steel at the same time. It was coarse and rough, with faint dots on the surface.
Ye Qingyu could still clearly remember that the image just now was that the chaotic storm had gathered down from the skies downwards. It was like a whale sucking in water, as if it had been compressed by some sort of power, ultimately becoming a solidified and compressed form.
A part of this formed into this pale white Domain Gate.
The Domain Gate was approximately a hundred meters tall, as well as hundred meters wide. It was like a gigantic door frame, without any doors.
The other portion of the remnants of the chaotic storm formed a huge stone plaque at the side of the Domain Gate.
This stone wall was much smaller than the stone gate. It was not even ten meters tall, and about four meters wide. It was a rectangle, like the side of a wall.
There was faint chaotic mist fluctuating around it, like light sand. The surface was undulating, like a micro universe, like a milky way. There were hundreds of large and small indents the size of a fist, each about five fingers deep on the stone plaque. It had a smooth inner wall, but with spherical indents on it.
These indents were not evenly distributed, and did not seem to have any rule about it. It was unknown just what it was to be used for and seemed rather special.
One side of the stone piece was connected to the right side of the stone gate. It was as if it was one structure, without any seams or connection.
The process of the chaotic qi compressing and consolidating to form the stone gate and stone wall seemed to finish in but an instant.
Previously, Ye Qingyu didn't have too much feeling for descriptive phrases such as 'Heavenly creations' or the 'work of the gods'.
But this time, seeing with his own eyes the chaotic qi that was throughout the sky turning into a stone gate and stone wall, as if there were the hands of an invisible deity creating everything, Ye Qingyu vision was broadened.
He was the first person who saw the stone gate and wall appearing.
Then news began to spread out.
Yu Junhan and the others also came at the first instance of such news.
Thousands of meters around it, the caution level was raised to its highest. There was the light of formations flickering in the air, blocking all the surveillance of the outer world. There were tens of thousands of elite army that had arranged the most terrifying killing formation, their blades and swords unsheathed, prepared to do battle at any instant.
Apart from the people of Light City, there were still Yu Junhan, the Right Minister, the Left Minister, the Crown Princess Yu Xiaoxing. Only they had the right to enter into the central area, standing before the stone gate and wall.
Within the air, there was space that emitted thick and concentrated yuan qi.
"The Central Domain Gate! It has finally appeared." There was a complex emotion appearing on Yu Junnhan's face. Her hand lightly stroked the pale white stone gate, as if there was something contained within.
"Behind this stone gate is the passageway that connects to other domains?" The Right Minister also evaluated this development with a curious expression.
As one of the movers and shakers of the empire, Lin Zheng had also seen some Domain Gates that were narrow and unstable before.
But perhaps it would be wrong to call them Domain Gates, they were more like cracks in space. Because they were all fractures in space time, and had many dangers within it. It was like they had been created by tearing apart the fabric of space itself.
Such Domain Gates had many instability attributes regarding it. They were extremely dangerous. There was the possibility of sending people and items through it to other domains, but there was also the possibility that it could completely kill and annihilate anything that entered it.
He had never ever seen such a Domain Gate that had such a form.
"But just how is this Domain Gate used?" There was a questioning expression on the Left Minsiter's face.“
This ancient stone gate seemed like a massive stone door. As they followed the nine steps and walked up, and after entering through the stone gate, they came to the other side.
On the surface, there was no possibility that could be discerned from entering through this gigantic stone gate that could lead you to another domain.
"Just what is the stone wall used for? Could it... act as a map?"
Yu Xiaoxing was also curiously evaluating the stone wall.
Yu Junhan turned around and smiled. "Xing'er, what you said is correct. The stone wall on the other side really can be used as a map. Do you see the sphere-shaped indents on the surface? Every indent represents a domain. As long as there is a divine class Origin crystal within it, then one can open the Central Domain Gate and enter into the domain that the indent represents."
So it was like this.
Ye Qingyu suddenly understood.
The stone gate could open a passage through spacetime, and the thing by the side was an item that had markers through spacetime.
It was hard to believe that such a peerless intricate item was naturally born.
The things created by the world were really utterly miraculous.
It was the first time Lin Zheng and the others had heard such an explanation, so they were evidently very shocked.
Carefully counting, there were in total a hundred and ninety-nine large and small indents on the stone wall. Could this represent a hundred and ninety-nine domains?
If one of them was Heaven Wasteland Domain, then did this not represent that there existed another hundred and ninety-eight other domains in this word?
Ye Qingyu sucked in a mouthful of cold breath.
There was so many?
Heaven Wasteland Domain was known as a newly formed domain. It had not entirely formed, but it was also vast and gigantic, as if it was endless. There were countless lifeforms being born from it, and it was already large enough as it is.
And those so called matured domains were world domains that had already completely grown. Just how massive would it be, and just what sort of lifeforms would it contain, with what sort of experts being born from it?
Thinking of this was enough to make everyone dizzy.
Everyone could hear Yu Junhan continuing, "There was once an ancient text that said that in this great universe, there are tens of thousands of domains. Our Heaven Wasteland Domain,is only a small domain amongst this great universe. It is like a drop of water in the ocean, a grain of sand in the desert, so small it cannot be noticed. These markers that have appeared are only a small portion out of the countless domains. The domains are like the stars in the skies, some are born and some are destroyed. If there are new domains being born, or perhaps it can sense some domains that it had not previously sensed before, there will be new indents formed... This is the profoundness of the laws of the Heavenly Way."
As these words were said, everyone that heard it was stunned.
The Jin Ling'er, Li Qi and Li Ying, who had sneakily followed the fatty Wang Lijin here curiously, had their mouths open in shock and disbelief, as if they were listening to a myth.
Lin Zheng and the others, whose heart had already been trained and hammered countless of times, and would not display emotions on their faces, still had shocks flickering deep within their eyes.
The shock and impact suh words had on everyone did not need to be described.
Furthermore, since these words were said from such an existence like Yu Junhan, everyone did not have a hint of suspicion, believing it entirely.
For people like Lin Zheng and Yu Feiyan, they guessed that such secrets were what the invincible peerless War God of the past had told Yu Junhan. Therefore, the matters that this invincible War God said, they would naturally choose to absolutely believe.
Only those who had experienced and had live through the the legendary times would know just how mysterious, powerful and almighty that person was. Only they knew just how many geniuses and tyrants would willingly bow down in front of that person, as devout as a worshipper, following him til death.
"As to what sort of domain each sphere shape indent represents, we need to find out on our own." The large majority of the time, Yu Junhan's gaze was focused towards Ye Qingyu. She continued, "The appearance of the Central Domain Gate of Heaven Wasteland Domain also means that on the other domains, there will also be an indent that represents Heaven Wasteland Domain appearing on those Domain Gates. Everyone should know what this represents.”
The expression of everyone turned serious.
This signified that other forces of other domains could enter into Heaven Wasteland Domain as they pleased as long as they had divine class Origin crystal and placed it within.
That meant that friends could arrive at any time.
Invasion was also possible at any moment.
From today onwards, if Heaven Wasteland Domain was unlucky and was faced with many powerful and fully matured domains, it was likely that a bloody battlefield would be caused in a very short period of time.
This was much more terrifying than the internal battles between the races of Heaven Wasteland Domain.
Once lost, there was a possibility that Heaven Wasteland Domain could become an enslaved domain.
All lifeforms within that domain would become slaves to a foreign domain.
Such was definitely not just projecting the worst scenario. There was a real possibility this could occur.
Within Ye Qingyu's heart, there was an acute sense of danger rising.
At ths time, the converging space yuan qi in the surroudning air suddenly became dense. The Domain Gate that was like a door suddenly let out a lively luster. A thin layer, like a mirror, like the water’s surface, began to appear within the Domain Gate.
A strange aura of a foreign domain surged out from the Domain Gate!
Connected!
The Domain Gate was really opened so quickly.
The hearts of everyone instantly skipped a beat.
"Attention!"
Lin Zheng roared.
Qu Hanshan directly sent a signal to the outside as the Imperial army prepared.
Faintly, there was a flash in the water-like mirror.
An item like black lighting shot out from within it.
Yu Junhan grabbed at it.
An invisible force shot out, completely freezing this black thing in place.
This was a thing that was like a dragon, a snake-like creature. It' head was like a flying snake, and was ink black. From it's appearance, it seemed extremely vicious and cruel.
It was only that only half of it's body had passed through the Domain Gate, seeming to be tens of meters long. Letting out a terrifying roar, it opened its mouth as sharp fangs bit towards Yu Junhan's wrist.
With the terrifying power of Yu Junhan, even she surprisingly was not enough to completely freeze it in space in an instant.
But the next instant, such a strange creature was still completely crushed into smithereens by Yu Junhan.
Then, the mirror within the Domain Gate began madly flashing and flickering.
There was unending creatures that charged out roaring.
Ye Qingyu's complexion changed.
Why was it that it was only vicious beasts that charged out?
Weren’t these vicious beast like the ones that appeared throughout the skies outside Deer City, that had once attacked Deer City and killed his own parents?
This... why had they charged out from the Domain Gate?
The Central Domain Gate was an incomparably large stone gate.
No one could be sure on the details of this stone gate. There were many people that could prove just what sort of material it was made from. It was pale white, and was like stone and like steel at the same time. It was coarse and rough, with faint dots on the surface.
Ye Qingyu could still clearly remember that the image just now was that the chaotic storm had gathered down from the skies downwards. It was like a whale sucking in water, as if it had been compressed by some sort of power, ultimately becoming a solidified and compressed form.
A part of this formed into this pale white Domain Gate.
The Domain Gate was approximately a hundred meters tall, as well as hundred meters wide. It was like a gigantic door frame, without any doors.
The other portion of the remnants of the chaotic storm formed a huge stone plaque at the side of the Domain Gate.
This stone wall was much smaller than the stone gate. It was not even ten meters tall, and about four meters wide. It was a rectangle, like the side of a wall.
There was faint chaotic mist fluctuating around it, like light sand. The surface was undulating, like a micro universe, like a milky way. There were hundreds of large and small indents the size of a fist, each about five fingers deep on the stone plaque. It had a smooth inner wall, but with spherical indents on it.
These indents were not evenly distributed, and did not seem to have any rule about it. It was unknown just what it was to be used for and seemed rather special.
One side of the stone piece was connected to the right side of the stone gate. It was as if it was one structure, without any seams or connection.
The process of the chaotic qi compressing and consolidating to form the stone gate and stone wall seemed to finish in but an instant.
Previously, Ye Qingyu didn't have too much feeling for descriptive phrases such as 'Heavenly creations' or the 'work of the gods'.
But this time, seeing with his own eyes the chaotic qi that was throughout the sky turning into a stone gate and stone wall, as if there were the hands of an invisible deity creating everything, Ye Qingyu vision was broadened.
He was the first person who saw the stone gate and wall appearing.
Then news began to spread out.
Yu Junhan and the others also came at the first instance of such news.
Thousands of meters around it, the caution level was raised to its highest. There was the light of formations flickering in the air, blocking all the surveillance of the outer world. There were tens of thousands of elite army that had arranged the most terrifying killing formation, their blades and swords unsheathed, prepared to do battle at any instant.
Apart from the people of Light City, there were still Yu Junhan, the Right Minister, the Left Minister, the Crown Princess Yu Xiaoxing. Only they had the right to enter into the central area, standing before the stone gate and wall.
Within the air, there was space that emitted thick and concentrated yuan qi.
"The Central Domain Gate! It has finally appeared." There was a complex emotion appearing on Yu Junnhan's face. Her hand lightly stroked the pale white stone gate, as if there was something contained within.
"Behind this stone gate is the passageway that connects to other domains?" The Right Minister also evaluated this development with a curious expression.
As one of the movers and shakers of the empire, Lin Zheng had also seen some Domain Gates that were narrow and unstable before.
But perhaps it would be wrong to call them Domain Gates, they were more like cracks in space. Because they were all fractures in space time, and had many dangers within it. It was like they had been created by tearing apart the fabric of space itself.
Such Domain Gates had many instability attributes regarding it. They were extremely dangerous. There was the possibility of sending people and items through it to other domains, but there was also the possibility that it could completely kill and annihilate anything that entered it.
He had never ever seen such a Domain Gate that had such a form.
"But just how is this Domain Gate used?" There was a questioning expression on the Left Minsiter's face.“
This ancient stone gate seemed like a massive stone door. As they followed the nine steps and walked up, and after entering through the stone gate, they came to the other side.
On the surface, there was no possibility that could be discerned from entering through this gigantic stone gate that could lead you to another domain.
"Just what is the stone wall used for? Could it... act as a map?"
Yu Xiaoxing was also curiously evaluating the stone wall.
Yu Junhan turned around and smiled. "Xing'er, what you said is correct. The stone wall on the other side really can be used as a map. Do you see the sphere-shaped indents on the surface? Every indent represents a domain. As long as there is a divine class Origin crystal within it, then one can open the Central Domain Gate and enter into the domain that the indent represents."
So it was like this.
Ye Qingyu suddenly understood.
The stone gate could open a passage through spacetime, and the thing by the side was an item that had markers through spacetime.
It was hard to believe that such a peerless intricate item was naturally born.
The things created by the world were really utterly miraculous.
It was the first time Lin Zheng and the others had heard such an explanation, so they were evidently very shocked.
Carefully counting, there were in total a hundred and ninety-nine large and small indents on the stone wall. Could this represent a hundred and ninety-nine domains?
If one of them was Heaven Wasteland Domain, then did this not represent that there existed another hundred and ninety-eight other domains in this word?
Ye Qingyu sucked in a mouthful of cold breath.
There was so many?
Heaven Wasteland Domain was known as a newly formed domain. It had not entirely formed, but it was also vast and gigantic, as if it was endless. There were countless lifeforms being born from it, and it was already large enough as it is.
And those so called matured domains were world domains that had already completely grown. Just how massive would it be, and just what sort of lifeforms would it contain, with what sort of experts being born from it?
Thinking of this was enough to make everyone dizzy.
Everyone could hear Yu Junhan continuing, "There was once an ancient text that said that in this great universe, there are tens of thousands of domains. Our Heaven Wasteland Domain,is only a small domain amongst this great universe. It is like a drop of water in the ocean, a grain of sand in the desert, so small it cannot be noticed. These markers that have appeared are only a small portion out of the countless domains. The domains are like the stars in the skies, some are born and some are destroyed. If there are new domains being born, or perhaps it can sense some domains that it had not previously sensed before, there will be new indents formed... This is the profoundness of the laws of the Heavenly Way."
As these words were said, everyone that heard it was stunned.
The Jin Ling'er, Li Qi and Li Ying, who had sneakily followed the fatty Wang Lijin here curiously, had their mouths open in shock and disbelief, as if they were listening to a myth.
Lin Zheng and the others, whose heart had already been trained and hammered countless of times, and would not display emotions on their faces, still had shocks flickering deep within their eyes.
The shock and impact suh words had on everyone did not need to be described.
Furthermore, since these words were said from such an existence like Yu Junhan, everyone did not have a hint of suspicion, believing it entirely.
For people like Lin Zheng and Yu Feiyan, they guessed that such secrets were what the invincible peerless War God of the past had told Yu Junhan. Therefore, the matters that this invincible War God said, they would naturally choose to absolutely believe.
Only those who had experienced and had live through the the legendary times would know just how mysterious, powerful and almighty that person was. Only they knew just how many geniuses and tyrants would willingly bow down in front of that person, as devout as a worshipper, following him til death.
"As to what sort of domain each sphere shape indent represents, we need to find out on our own." The large majority of the time, Yu Junhan's gaze was focused towards Ye Qingyu. She continued, "The appearance of the Central Domain Gate of Heaven Wasteland Domain also means that on the other domains, there will also be an indent that represents Heaven Wasteland Domain appearing on those Domain Gates. Everyone should know what this represents.”
The expression of everyone turned serious.
This signified that other forces of other domains could enter into Heaven Wasteland Domain as they pleased as long as they had divine class Origin crystal and placed it within.
That meant that friends could arrive at any time.
Invasion was also possible at any moment.
From today onwards, if Heaven Wasteland Domain was unlucky and was faced with many powerful and fully matured domains, it was likely that a bloody battlefield would be caused in a very short period of time.
This was much more terrifying than the internal battles between the races of Heaven Wasteland Domain.
Once lost, there was a possibility that Heaven Wasteland Domain could become an enslaved domain.
All lifeforms within that domain would become slaves to a foreign domain.
Such was definitely not just projecting the worst scenario. There was a real possibility this could occur.
Within Ye Qingyu's heart, there was an acute sense of danger rising.
At ths time, the converging space yuan qi in the surroudning air suddenly became dense. The Domain Gate that was like a door suddenly let out a lively luster. A thin layer, like a mirror, like the water’s surface, began to appear within the Domain Gate.
A strange aura of a foreign domain surged out from the Domain Gate!
Connected!
The Domain Gate was really opened so quickly.
The hearts of everyone instantly skipped a beat.
"Attention!"
Lin Zheng roared.
Qu Hanshan directly sent a signal to the outside as the Imperial army prepared.
Faintly, there was a flash in the water-like mirror.
An item like black lighting shot out from within it.
Yu Junhan grabbed at it.
An invisible force shot out, completely freezing this black thing in place.
This was a thing that was like a dragon, a snake-like creature. It' head was like a flying snake, and was ink black. From it's appearance, it seemed extremely vicious and cruel.
It was only that only half of it's body had passed through the Domain Gate, seeming to be tens of meters long. Letting out a terrifying roar, it opened its mouth as sharp fangs bit towards Yu Junhan's wrist.
With the terrifying power of Yu Junhan, even she surprisingly was not enough to completely freeze it in space in an instant.
But the next instant, such a strange creature was still completely crushed into smithereens by Yu Junhan.
Then, the mirror within the Domain Gate began madly flashing and flickering.
There was unending creatures that charged out roaring.
Ye Qingyu's complexion changed.
Why was it that it was only vicious beasts that charged out?
Weren’t these vicious beast like the ones that appeared throughout the skies outside Deer City, that had once attacked Deer City and killed his own parents?
This... why had they charged out from the Domain Gate?
