Chapter 377:


“Third Huangshu, what do you mean?” There was a coldness that spread across Xing’er’s face.
Yu Feiyan smiled.
“This is only a spar. There is no need to worry,” the cold faced youth carrying a blade in the green clothes said calmly. “Unless Princess you have no confidence in the strength of [War God]?”
“Who do you think you are? Do you think you have the right to speak to me?” There was an iciness and fury that filled Xing’er’s beautiful pupils. Then she gave a glare like lightning at him, “You are only a begging dog at the mercy of someone else. Your master hasn’t even spoken, but you dare bark? Do you know the rules?”
The expression of the green-clothed blade bearer turned berserk.
There was a fury that flickered in his pupils. The blade in his hands shook, and there was a fierce aura that seeped to ones bones passing by in the air. This was a killing aura that was ultimately suppressed.
The other guests of the Apex Prince behind him also had different expressions.
Although she was a princess, but the words of this girl were really too harsh and humiliating towards them. It was like thorn after thorn that stabbed into these people with extraordinary abilities. There were even people with worse tempers amongst them that directly stood up, his face unfriendly as he glared at Xing’er.
If this little girl was not the princess of the Empire, they would have long acted and crushed her.
But in the air, there were hidden currents and killing intent that surged over and attacked her.
These were the guests of the Apex Prince acting hiddenly against her. They wanted to teach this little princess with such a horrid mouth a lesson. The aim was not to hurt her but to make her learn.
“Impudence!”
The expression of Yu Feiyan changed, his sleeve lightly swiping.
The hidden air currents that surged towards Xing’er completely dissipated.
Yu Feiyan was originally a martial expert with deep and unfathomable strength. He came from the Imperial family, and there was the bloodline of martial experts flowing through his body. He had countless martial cultivation techniques he could study, limitless cultivation resource he could use. Compared to a normal person, he was infinitely more blessed. It was only that his official power was too high, and he rarely acted personally. Therefore his martial fame was not too evident.
“Haha, Third Huangshu, the dogs that you raise are really disobedient.”
Xing’er coldly mocked.
If there was a gentleness and intimateness that flashed by when she saw Yu Feiyan, then after that cold-faced green-clothed blade bearer challenged Ye Qingyu to a spar, that gentleness completely disappeared. The youth that was eccentric, but did not possess high personal strength in Ye Qingyu’s impression seemed suddenly as if she had changed into a completely different person. Right now, she was incomparably icy and harsh.
Yu Feiyan shook his head with a smile, not saying anything.
Towards this niece, he had a helplessness from spoiling her too mouth.
“You are still as sharp-tongued as ever. I remember when you were small, you even dared to scold at your father. We made you go learn the Painting Arts from Liu Yuqing to control your temper, but it seemed you have not grown…” Yu Feiyan smiled. “I know what you are thinking. You feel that I have sought you intentionally today to make things difficult for your little boyfriend, is that right? Little girl, you are overthinking it… But the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] that belongs to the Imperial family appeared in his hands and to the world once again, this is something I cannot stand by and let happen. Since we met coincidentally, this is only a martial contest, so why don’t we let them fight and just stop before anyone gets hurt?”
This tone seemed to be negotiating something with Xing’er, but it did not leave her much room to decline.
Xing’er coldly sneered, and was about to say something, but Ye Qingyu next to her stepped forward, lightly grabbed her sleeve and shook his head. “Let me take care of this.”
Then he paid a greeting towards Yu Feiyan. “Since the Apex Prince has personally spoken, then I will not decline. I can only follow orders.”
Yu Feiyan nodded.
Xing’er looked like she was about to say something, but ultimately did not open her mouth.
Ye Qingyu smiled, and turned around. He walked over, once again facing the green-clothed bladesman. “May I ask your name?”
From start to finish, he did not have any emotional fluctuation.
No matter whether when it was Xing’er exploding with anger, or Yu Feiyan speaking, he was terrifyingly calm.
Right now, facing the stare of Ye Qingyu, he calmly returned Ye Qingyu’s gaze. “Xiao Lou.”
There was a shock that was exposed in Ye Qingyu’s eyes.
“Xiao Lou? The [Listening to Spring Rain at Night], Xiao Lou?” He could not help but ask further.
The opposing party still nodded his head.
The [Listening to Spring Rain at Night], Xiao Lou!
Ye Qingyu deeply breathed in. There was a battle will that gradually began to burn in his chest.
Because no matter whether it was the Dugu family, the Ouyang family or the Two River Gang, the information they provided all mentioned this name.
This somewhat feminine name had once shaken the entire Snow Capital.
One year ago, Xiao Lou had appeared in the capital.
No one knew where he came from or who he was.
They only knew that one year ago when he appeared in the capital, he had incited a bloody battle!
A year and one month ago, the first battle Xiao Lou had was with the [Tearing Heaven Hands], Chen Nan. The latter was a famed expert who had long entered into the Stream state of the Bitter Sea stage. But he was defeated in one strike by Xiao Lou.
Eleven months ago, Xiao Lou once again challenged the [Transforming Heavens Absolute Claws], Li Guiyuan. He had defeated him completely.
Ten months ago, Xiao Lou had challenged the [Tyrannical Blade], Jiang Feng. He had defeated him completely again.
Nine months and eleven days ago…
Eight months ago…
Eight months and eighteen days ago…
In this year and a month, this bladesman called Xiao Lou had defeated twenty-one famed experts within the capital with only his palm and carrying that curved blade with a black hilt!
Twenty-one battles. No matter whether it was he who challenged others or them who challenged him, he had never suffered defeat.
Within the capital, for an outsider, such a battle record was absolutely earth shaking.
Therefore Xiao Lou’s name had spread throughout the capital.
But without knowing why, six months ago, he had suddenly disappeared from public sight and became much more low key. It was rumoured that this martial genius had gone to Yu Feiyan’s factions. From the current scene today, this rumour was not wrong.
There was still a black hilted curved blade in the arms of this young expert. But it was rumoured that he had only used his hands when he defeated his opponents.
No one knew, just how terrifying the power would be when his blade came out of its sheath.
There were people that were worth him unsheathing his sword for.
But the people who had seen his sword had all died.
To think that he would encounter the challenge of this person today.
There was not any fear in Ye Qingyu’s heart, but an expectant excitement.
Tho fight with a true top level expert was really an opportunity that was hard to obtain.
“Please!”
Ye Qingyu lifted his hands, pointing to the little martial courtyard far away.
Xiao Lou gave a glance to Yu Feiyan.
Yu Feiyan let out a chuckle. “Prepare the arena.”
As his voice sounded out, there were two guests that walked out from the crowd behind the Apex Prince.
From their appearance, these two guest masters should be formation smithing masters. They were definitely not normal people. They wore long robes of scarlet red and had a serious aura. Their hands formed seals, and there were formation tools that were thrown out. Their fingers constantly changed their positions, and shadows began seeping out between their fingers, smothering the heavens.
There was a vast energy fluctuating in the air.
The two guest masters willed it, and their hand seals that were constantly transforming finally halted.
At that moment, the floating and spinning shadows quickly descended, landing on the deck.
“Bang!”
Along with a hum, the shadows on the dock quickly constructed themselves into a strange and complicated formation array. There was a light screen that was born from this that wrapped Ye Qingyu as well as Xiao Lou within, isolating their aura.
Everyone backed away.
Yu Feiyan returned to the purple gold throne, sitting there calmly.
There were some guards that found a luxurious soft wood chair from somewhere and indicated for Xing’er to take a seat.
Princess Xing’er looked with burning eyes towards the situation.
At the same time, both Ye Qingyu and Xiao Lou that was within the formation array could not hear the noise outside at all nor could they see the outside at all
To prevent disturbing the spar between the two, the guards had already erected a formation that isolated the two from the outside world. Not even a wisp of wind could enter.
Ye Qingyu looked around him, then his gaze looked away from the light projection that constantly undulated. Courteously, he said, “Please.”
Before he had finished.
““Whoosh!
Ye Qingyu heard an extremely piercing noise from his ear. There was a figure that flashed in the air.
Xiao Lou had fiercely stepped out, leaping. HIs figure was like lightning, directly attacking straight at Ye Qingyu.
In the light of a spark, Xiao Lou had already leapt into the air above Ye Qingyu.
There was a pale black blade sheath in his hands that struck down from the skies. There was a purple moonlight radiance in the skies, even the air itself was ripped apart. There were constantly sounds of explosions.
Such an offensive had the aura of seemingly beheading Heaven and Earth. This shocked even Ye Qingyu.
But this was not the palm strike that defeated so many famed experts.
This was striking out with his blade sheath.
Ye Qingyu suddenly deeply breathed in. There was force fluctuating in his body that flowed into his right arm. His inner yuan suddenly exploded, and an infinite cold aura boiled, the cold seeping aura spreading everywhere into the bones. With an enraged shout, his hands formed into a fist that struck towards Xiao Lou!
The [Dragon Fist] mantra.
The first technique that Ye Qingyu acted with, was the technique he used the most recently.
“Boom!Boom!Boom!Boom!“
They faced each other, neither preparing to give an inch!
the instant the fist met with the blade sheath, there was a terrifying power that exploded and tore apart the surrounding air!
The explosive booms in the air were like beans bursting in the air, so loud that even the deaf could hear it.
After their initial testing, Ye Qingyu retreated some steps while Xiao Lou only took a step and a half back.
“An extremely powerful fellow. This fist used half of my power. After the military training, half of my power is no longer someone at the same state as me can fight against! But this fellow barely seemed to expend any effort in receiving this blow.”
“This person’s strength, is definitely above myself!”
There was such a thought that appeared in Ye Qingyu’s mind. Deeply breathing in, he suppressed the numbness originating from his right fist.
And within Xiao Lou’s eyes, his cold gaze had finally changed. There was a scorching heat within, the aura in his body rapidly rising, like the tide fiercely gathering!
“Whoosh!”
The next instant, Xiao Lou once again demonstrated his quick footwork. The blade hilt held in his hearts seemed to sense the excitement of his master. It faintly shook, emitting humming noises!
The two once again struck against each other, locked in battle!
The will of the fists were like Dragons.
The gust of the blade was like lightning.
When they exchanged blows, there was a terrifying force that began to spread —
“Third Huangshu, what do you mean?” There was a coldness that spread across Xing’er’s face.
Yu Feiyan smiled.
“This is only a spar. There is no need to worry,” the cold faced youth carrying a blade in the green clothes said calmly. “Unless Princess you have no confidence in the strength of [War God]?”
“Who do you think you are? Do you think you have the right to speak to me?” There was an iciness and fury that filled Xing’er’s beautiful pupils.

========================================

Chapter 378:


The battle, in the time of just a couple of breaths, had entered a white hot scorching stage.

The battle hooked everyone's hearts.

Xing'er seemed to be peacefully sitting where she was. But right now she was already tightly clenching onto her fists, biting onto her lips. Her brows were faintly knitted, her gaze focused completely towards Ye Qingyu, her heart slowly becoming worried.

Although she knew that Ye Qingyu had extremely strong cards hidden up his sleeve, but this girl could not help but be worried.

In this first exchange, Ye Qingyu seemed to be at the disadvantage. Xing'er could not help but be worried for Ye Qingyu.

"Little Ye, do your best!”

Xing'er shouted this in her heart.

The other side.

The Apex Prince, Yu Feiyan, sitting on the purple gold dragon throne, also focused completely on the two locked in battle within the formation barrier. His brows knitted as he showed a thoughtful expression.

"From the current situation, Ye Qingyu is not Xiao Lou's opponent. But this [Dragon Fist]..."

Yu Feiyan was a grandmaster in terms of martial cultivation, and he was also exceedingly familiar towards the martial path of the Imperial family. That was why he only needed to pay a glance at the [Dragon Fist] exhibited by Ye Qingyu to know there was something different contained within.

Under the gaze of everyone, Ye Qingyu had already fallen into disadvantage within the formation.

"Hu! Hu! Hu!”

That normal blade sheath seemed even more mighty in Xiao Lou’s hands than other mysterious divine weapons. It struck with tens of blade lights that seemed like they were real, all striking at Ye Qingyu's vitals.

"Ding!Ding!Ding!"

The yuan power around Ye Qingyu was activated to the extreme. He fiercely stood where he was, bending at the knees as he took a stance. It was as if his legs had grown roots to the dock. He did not dodge nor evade. Fist after fist, seeming sluggish but rapid, he constantly struck out with the might of the [Dragon Fist].

The blade techniques of Xiao Lou were indeed quick. Amongst the young experts, his speed could be compared to [Flowing Light] who specialized in speed.

But since Ye Qingyu could handle [Flowing Light], then he could naturally also handle Xiao Lou.

It was only that something had caught Ye Qingyu's attention.

“An extremely powerful fellow! His blade techniques are simple and unadorned, but there is a killing intent contained within. It is now rarely seen. Is it the ancient blade techniques left behind after the age of the sects when Snow Empire was founded? Just what is this Xiao Lou's background? It is rumoured that no one knows about his background at all. Could he be some successor to some sect from the age of sects?"

As Ye Qingyu thought, his expressions constantly flickered.

There were tens of blade lights that appeared in front of him. Ye Qingyu did not panic. In a split second, his right fist fiercely struck out, tens of times in but a moment!

Ye Qingyu's entire person seemed to be surrounded by an endless and unending fist mirage that protected him, causing one's eyesight to go dizzy at the sight of it.

"Boom!Boom!Boom!Boom!“

The countless fists and light of the blade struck against each other.

The air in the restricting formation vibrated and undulated from the frightening force released by both parties. It shook constantly, and there would occasionally be numerous fist shadows or blade shadows that struck out, fiercely striking the light projection of the restricting formation. It let out shudders and tremors everywhere.

"Ding!Ding!Ding!Ding!"

The fist and blade shadows had already completely filled the restricting formation. The figures of the two seemed to be completely enveloped by such shadows. It was as if they were two ancient beasts, madly attacking and striking each other, fighting a completely chaotic battle!

Ye Qingyu could still last for a short period.

But after a period, the speed of his fists had evidently gone down.

Xing'er got a fright in her heart seeing such a scene as he constantly stared at Ye Qingyu.

"Crap! Little Ye's balance has evidently been shaken, he won't be able to endure it much longer!"

It was not only her who noticed such a point. Xiao Lou was also able to discern this. There was a viciousness that appeared between his brows. At the same time as he pulled his blade back, his feet flickered. The next instant, he disappeared like a ghost in front of Ye Qingyu.

"En?"

There was a coldness that passed by Ye Qingyu's lips.

All the muscles in his body tensed, as he stared cautiously around his surroundings.

Suddenly!

“Whoosh!”

There was the sound of the air being pierced sharply that rang out unexpectedly from behind him.

The figure of Xiao Lou appeared like a ghost behind Ye Qingyu. His blade sheath struck out at Ye Qingyu's knees with tremendous strength.

The power and speed held in this blade strike caused mirage to be born in the air. The terrifying power it exploded with at that instant was at a level enough so that if it struck, Ye Qingyu's knees would definitely be chopped off.

Xing'er's eyebrows shot up.

"An extremely strange and crafty blade technique. The footwork of this Xiao Lou is like a ghost, his inner force and speed has already been trained to the extreme. Little Ye, Little Ye, stop playing around, quickly explode with your power and take out your trump cards. If this continues on, you will definitely fall.”

There were expressions of excitement that appeared on many of the guest masters of the Prince's residence.

Anyone with clear vision could see that in such distance and with the explosive speed that Xiao Lou acted with, it was impossible for Ye Qingyu to block this move.

Only Yu Feiyan's expression did not change.

And at that crucial moment---

"Hou!"

Ye Qingyu let out a loud roar.

In his mind, the nameless breathing technique activated. His senses were raised to the extreme. Not even turning his head, the force in his body transferred into his fists, and his body bending back like a massive python that struck behind him with a strange form!

The two fists that carried the entire power of Ye Qingyu's body headed straight for Xiao Lou's face.

The [Dragon Fist] was like a cannon that exploded out.

At the moment when he struck out with his fist, there was a fierce energy that emitted from Ye Qingyu's body. It made one have the mistaken impression that a vicious dragon was roaring, soaring out from somewhere and possessing Ye Qingyu.

This was a punch that reversed the situation!

If Xiao Lou did not block this move, this blade would definitely be able to chop of Ye Qingyu's knees.

But at the same time, he would suffer Ye Qingyu's offensive that was like a torrential rainstorm.

He would kill a thousand of the enemies, but in the process eight hundred soldiers of his would die in the proces!

In a split second, Xiao Lou ultimately bit his teeth. He forcefully changed his move, and his wrist emitted a powerful energy that dragged the blade sheath into a defensive position, blocking in front of himself.

"Bang!"

At that moment, Ye Qingyu's fists landed heavily on Xiao Lou's blade sheath.

Xiao Lou let out a low grunt, his body staggering backwards. He flew back tens of meters before he could stabilize, his gaze filled with shock as he stared at Ye Qingyu.

It was not only him, the people spectating the battle could not be still.

Xing'er could not help but widen her eyes, her gaze filled with a strange colour as he looked towards Ye Qingyu. There was an upward quirk on her lips as she exposed a smile.

"I long knew, this fellow was exposing a weakness on purpose. With his rich battle experience, how could he show such an evident weak point. It's only that it's a pity, he did not truly defeat Xiao Lou. The advantage of Little Ye lies in his power. Both his fists struck squarely on him, but he did not manage to heavily injure Xiao Lou. This person wielding the blade, really lives up to the rumours."

There was finally a trace of shock that appeared on the face of the Apex Prince that seemed as if it would never alter. Others could perhaps overlook it, but he would definitely spot it!

"That move just now, contained the power of the pinnacle of the [Dragon Fist] mantra.”

"The [Dragon Fist] is the secret of the Imperial family. The [Dragon Fist] passed on outside today are versions where there are imperfections. Only the Imperial family has the requirement to cultivate the perfect technique! This Ye Qingyu was one of the people chosen, and had once trained at the military department. Learning the [Dragon Fist] is within expectations, but the [Dragon Fist] he learned should be the imperfect version. But right now, why is it that the power he exploded with is comparable to the perfect technique? Could he be..."

Yu Feiyan gave a glance to Xing'er.

Who would have thought that this girl had given the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] to her lover, but also passed on the complete form of the [Dragon Fist] mantra to him?

The Apex Prince believed in his own judgement.

But this time, he was wrong.

On the arena.

At this time, the complexion of Xiao Lou's face was completely red. Blood was still boiling in his chest. His expression constantly flickered. Biting his teeth, he regarded Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu stood where he was, his aura calm and stable. There was faint dragon qi fluctuating in his body.

Suddenly---

"Phew..." Xiao Lou deeply breathed in, then he stably breathed in and out. At that moment, it was as if everything in the restriction had quieted down. There were no sounds at al.

With Ye Qingyu tightly watching him, Xiao Lou slowly opened his mouth. His cold voice accompanied by a trace of rage, sounded out throughout the entire restricting formation, "Somewhat interesting... but it is by far not enough for you to be known as [War God].”

"This is my last move, receive it."

The voice sounded.

"Bang!"

A vast energy and aura began activating on Xiao Lou's body, that berserkly rose. At just an instant, he had already reached the pinnacle.

At that instant, Ye Qingyu felt that the aura coming from Xiao Lou's body was like a flood, like the roar and howl of an ancient beast. Pushing forward without any obstacles, it pressed down on his shoulders so that even his four limbs could barely move.

At that moment, it was as if time stopped.

Xiao Lou slowly lifted the blade sheath in his hands, and that purple gold blade sheath seemed to have become part of Xiao Lou's body at that moment.

From the perspective of the spectator, his speed was extremely slow. It seemed like even a spectator would be able to easily avoid it.

Only Ye Qingyuunderstood the terror and profoundness behind this as he stood within the formation.

At this time, Ye Qingyu stared tightly as Xiao Lou's hand moved, and the blade sheath striking at him. Ye Qingyu looked all around.

But he discovered that no matter where or how he dodged, it was impossible to evade that strike.

The killing aura that exploding berserkly had already locked down all the places he could escape from!

Such a strange sensation caused Ye Qingyu's heart to jump.

Such a blade technique, why was it so similar to the mysteries behind the [Human King Sword Mantra]?

At that same time, outside the restricting formation.

Seeing this scene, Yu Feiyan's brows that were tightly locked finally relaxed. "Exterminating World Sword Power, the ultimate technique of Xiao Lou. There is not any sort of blade moves, and it just solely relies on the power of the sword to crush everything in front of it. It has the power to destroy heaven and rend the earth. Ye Qingyu, even if you have three heads and six arms, you cannot avoid this. Ye Qingyu, although you are exceptional, but you still have lost."

Ye Qingyu did not plan to evade anymore. His eyes instead faintly closed, his entire person falling into an incomparably tranquil state.

In a blink, the blade sheath of Xiao Lou had reached within three inches of Ye Qingyu's head. The next moment, he would receive a destructive strike.

Suddenly!

Ye Qingyu fiercely opened both his eyes, his pupils constricting. There was a flash of electrical light that passed by in his eyes at that moment!

In but a moment's time.

A vast energy suddenly exploded from Ye Qingyu's body, soaring to the clouds!-----

Chapter 379:


Translator Note: I've double checked the raws and the sites - it seems the author has made an error in numbering the chapters. So the numbering system jumps from 379 ->>>398. The story continues, just a mistake in numbering. However I will have to keep it consistent with the raws, so apologies for the discontinuity in the numbering system.

Chapter 398 - Do you think I can pull out this blade?

Waves of imposing manner were swelling within Ye Qingyu, rising little by little. It was as though a fierce demon beast that had been imprisoned for thousands of years was finally freed, completely hysterical!

“Roar!”

All of the people saw the inside of that invisible void, the two imposing auras were forming into a vortex, spinning rapidly, fighting against each other, frantically colliding against each other, and tearing at each other. Blood and flesh splattered about and dyeing the skies red!

That imposing aura that was a hindrance to Ye Qingyu’s movement instantaneously shattered into pieces!

Ye Qingyu, at this moment, seemed to have changed to another person. An unprecedented power broke out from him, the surrounding flow of air rumbling like a waterfall gushing down, and from his body exuded an overbearing imposing aura that made the people feel he was possessed by the god of war. Nothing could stand against him!

[Limitless Divine Way], [First Limit]!

Once the [Limitless Divine Way] was activated, it would subvert even the heavenly way!

With the current strength of Ye Qingyu and the explosive state of the [First Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way], his battle strength had doubled. The strength that he possessed now would make even a top expert of the River stage of the Bitter Sea stage  have second thoughts. His fist that was flooding with explosive power, suddenly struck at Xiao Lou’s terrifying purple gold sheath!

“Bang!”

In the instant the two forces collided, an overbearing strength suddenly exploded out. The entire restricted void was wildly torn apart and shattered!

Annihilation!

The remaining blasts of powerful qi that were produced caused the prohibited light canopy formation to quake. Ripples floated out, rocking, like a little boat was trying to survive in the midst of a storm, in seemingly imminent danger.

The incomparably dazzling rays of light flooded the entire prohibited area, blinding everyone’s eyes and completely swallowing the two bodies. For a long moment there were no signs of them.

A long while after...

From the restricted light canopy formation, there were faint sounds of cracking and rupturing, and soon it collapsed.

The light scattered away.

Xing’er subconsciously opened her eyes to take a look. Inside the prohibited area were two figures standing with their hands clasped behind their back, eyes fixed on each other.

The supreme skills that the two people displayed were evenly matched, equal to each other!

The aftermath of the battle was still spreading across the air.

The airflow around the two figures was like a broken vortex, flowing slowly and looking extremely unnatural. The rising and falling of airflow were visible to the naked eye and shrouding the two figures as before.

There was an utter silence above the battleship.

After a long while, the dozens of flabbergasted guests finally broke into commotion.

“Evenly matched?”

“The boy... No wonder he claims to be the [War God], he is indeed amazing... to draw with Xiao Lou. This achievement, if spread out, would be enough to create a stir in the Jianghu of the imperial capital, right?”

“We can’t be sure yet... Xiao Lou hasn’t pulled out his blade yet.”

“The problem is that Xiao Lou has not pulled out his blade, his black blade is like a decoration. The people that lost to him befor were defeated by his palm techniques... Who knows if this guy was just bluffing with that blade?”

“But today Xiao Lou has always been using sword skills.”

“Do you mean, Xiao Lou had not attacked with all his strength yet.”

“That is very terrifying, which of us could withstand five attacks from Xiao Lou? Among all the guest masters, there is only a handful of people that could do such a thing. The little princess’s boyfriend is really impressive.”

“And he’s younger than Xiao Lou... Everyone, I remember the reason why Xiao Lou was regarded as important by the many forces of the imperial capital and was chosen by our Prince. It’s because he is young, right?”

“Another demon-like talent.”

The dialogue among the visitors, although their voices were deliberately lowered, but was still heard by Prince Yu Feiyan and Xing’er, two martial arts experts.

A slight smile crossed Yu Feiyan’s face.

It was obvious that he seemed more satisfied with the result.

“Girl, it seems you picked the right person .This Ye Qingyu is indeed a talented person, although his background is a bit low, but our Snow Empire Imperial family also started from nothing. As long as men have enough strength, they can change everything. This kid is handsome, has a tough mind, is gifted and outstanding, and matches well with you. No wonder you gave him the [Three Thousand  Feet of White Hair]... However, the matter between you two, wouldn’t it still need your father’s approval?”

Yu Feiyan looked at Xing’er smiling.

“Uncle you’re thinking too much, I never said that he is the one I love...” Xing’er replied, expressionless.

“According to the iron law of the empire’s imperial household, giving him the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair], is equal to choosing him to be your husband. If he is not the one you love, you should already know the consequences...” In Yu Feiyan’s palm was a whirling purple-gold armrest of the imperial thron. Smiling, he continued, “I know that you’re usually very mischievous, but you’re unlikely to go so far as to disregard the imperial family’s tradition. The one that a woman of the Snow Empire’s Imperial family give their strand of white hair to is the one they love.”

Xing’er did not say a word for a long while.

“What? Don’t tell me regret it, Ye Qingyu is so talented at such a young age, he is considered as  a one in a million genius. Uncle also extremely admires his talent. He is a good match for our little witch, haha...” Yu Feiyan began laughing heartily. From his words, he seemed rather open-minded and deeply concerned about Xing’er.

Xing’er smiled faintly. “Just because he tied with your dog that has the sharpest teeth?”

Yu Feiyan helplessly shook his head. “Girl, ever since you came back, you’ve been avoiding me. Do you have some issues with me, or do you dislike my guest masters?”

“What’s the difference?” Xing’er indifferent curled her lips. “If you think that it is already very impressive that Qingyu could remain undefeated under Xiao Lou’s blade, then I can only say that you still do not understand [The Leaf of Youyan]. Since he accepted this so-called battle of learning from each other, he would not be satisfied with such a result.”

Yu Feiyan was taken aback.

In the martial arts ground.

“Pull out your blade.”

Ye Qingyu was slowly moving his body about, activating strength within his body, real physical strength bursting forth, roars of dragons echoing inside his muscles and bones, as though there were countless divine dragons about to come out from his body.

“What?”

Xiao Lou was astonished, the pupils of his eyes shrinking abruptly.

“Before, you... were suppressing your strength to fight with me?” On Xiao Lou’s face emerged an anger triggered by humiliation.

“Didn’t you also suppress your strength?” Ye Qingyu faintly smiled. “People from the era of sects, their methods of fighting are a completely ancient style. Why did you not pull the blade? Because you do not want to kill me? Or do you know that even if you draw your blade you’re not going to kill me? Or... are you afraid of drawing a blade in front of so many people and exposing your true identity?”

The expression on Xiao Lou’s face instantly calmed down.

“You’re thinking too much.” His hand slowly grasped the blade hilt.

His slender, soft and fair fingers were more beautiful than some women that pay particular attention to the maintenance of their fingers. If this was another place, another occasion, few people would be able to link such a beautiful hand to the frightening bloody hand that had taken part in the serial killing of twenty-one martial artist in the imperial capital in one year.

Ye Qingyu did not speak.

Drawing a deep breath.

[True Will of the Sky Dragon] was in operation.

His right hand was instantly covered by light silvery dragon scales, his fingers also becoming a dragon claw.

At the same time, activating the [Human King Sword Mantra].

The true meaning of swordsmanship was gathered on the right dragon claw, rumbling out like lightning.

The sword-air whistled and the chill pervaded the air.

A look of surprise crossed Xiao Lou’s face, and without the time to even hesitate, his right hand that was originally tightly gripping the black hilt, suddenly shot out like lightning, and his originally fair jade-like palm instantly turned black as ink, as if it could devour all the power of the world.

The next moment, the black palm and the silver dragon claw clashed.

This time there was no fluctuation of energy.

There was no deafening sound.

Not even a faint breeze.

That split second of contact was like a friendly tap between two good friends, the palm and fist were lifted, and then tightly glued together again, and not immediately separated.

Bang bang bang.

Beneath the two people came a muffled sound.

The deck that was strengthened with the power of the mysterious rune inscription was like rippling water. The location of the two people had sunk and numerous rune inscriptions were flashing like crazily. The metal deck that was floating in the air seemed like it would collapse at any time...

It was clear that the strength that these two people endured at this very moment was absolutely violent and tyrannical. It was absolutely not as easy as it looked on the surface.

Such a stalemate probably lasted less than ten seconds.

Xiao Lou’s face was suddenly flushed red like he was drunk, his eyebrows scrunched up, then blood slowly trickled down from his mouth. Like he was exhausted, he began trembling.

Ye Qingyu actually still had ample strength.

“So the origin of your strength comes from your blade.” His eyes lit up for a second as he realized, then he continued in an indifferent tone, “So the reason you did not draw the blade is because your current level of cultivation cannot pull out this blade... The so-called people that have seen you pull the blade are all dead, it is only a rumor. What ancient sect of the era of sects was your master in?”

Xiao Lou glared at Ye Qingyu and did not speak.

“For ashes to want to rekindle?” Ye Qingyu’s eyes also gradually become ice-cold. “The era of the sects has passed, it is impossible for it to return... It’s time for you people to forget such a time.”

“You overestimate yourself...” Xiao Lou opened his mouth to speak, when his body trembled even more.

From inside of Ye Qingyu’s arm, suddenly came the roar of a dragon, more forceful than before.

“Ah... pfff!”

Xiao Lou finally could not hold on any longer, blood gushed out from his mouth, and his body was propelled away.

Ye Qingyu waved his hand.

The black blade in his hand that was twirling and attempting to fly away, fell into the hands of Ye Qingyu, still struggling and vibrating, but unable free itself from Ye Qingyu’s silver scaled dragon claw.

“Give back my blade...”

Xiao Lou roared. His expression took a huge change, the first time he showed the look of shock and panic. He counter attacked frantically.

Ye Qingyu laughed, his left hand turning into a dragon claw.

His right hand was holding the scabbard, his left hand was clasping the hilt, saying indifferently, “Do you think I can pull out this blade?”

Xiao Lou’s figure abruptly stopped——

Chapter 380:


Chapter 399 - The opportunity came too suddenly

Both of Ye Qingyu’s hands transformed into dragon claws, holding the strange curved black blade.

Xiao Lou’s entire body, as though it had stiffened abruptly, dared not to move an inch, afraid that his tiniest movement would trigger Ye Qingyu. It would cause him to really exert force and pull out the black blade.

The atmosphere was a little weird.

All gazes were focused on Ye Qingyu.

Everyone could see the fearful as well as angry expression on Xiao Lou’s face, and the silver scales and silver flames curling around Ye Qingyu’s hands, which stirred a strange feeling in everyone’s hearts.

Including Yu Feiyan and Xing’er.

It was evident, now that the battle had progressed to this degree, even an idiot could tell that, the youngster with the codename [War God] had won, won completely and won utterly.

The last black ink-like palm image that Xiao Lou thrust out was the palm technique that had defeated countless Bitter Sea experts in the imperial capital before. It was the most powerful move of Xiao Lou, but also a move that countless famous top experts could not see through and dared not receive.

But Ye Qingyu received it head-on.

Not only received it.

But utterly destroyed this palm.

Xiao Lou vomited blood and sustained serious injury.

This palm and this mouthful of blood were tantamount to a little martial arts myth being shattered.

While that claw and silver dragon scale paw were the beginning of another little martial arts myth.

As for the black blade...

Everyone could, from Xiao Lou’s unprecedented facial expression which could be called as an expression of panic, read a subtle message: this blade has a very special significance for Xiao Lou, not only because it was his defensive weapon or precious treasure, there were other reasons, other deeper significant meanings behind it.

And Xiao Lou was evidently extremely worried that Ye Qingyu was really going to pull out the curved blade.

What would happen when he pulled the blade out of its sheath?

All eyes fell upon Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu did not speak.

His gaze, calm with a trace of curiosity, was examining the dark as though ink-stained scabbard inch by inch, like he was caught up in deep thought, and seemed to be hesitant over something.

This seemingly ordinary and mediocre curved black blade was evidently emitting a kind of majestic power. Even through the black scabbard Ye Qingyu could feel his heart thudding. But it was clear that because of the scabbard, the power inside was not able to be unleashed fully. Ye Qingyu suddenly had a theory: if he drew the sword out of the sheath at this moment, the power that was as terrifying as a monstrous flood may pour out instantly.

He grasped the hilt with one hand and grabbed the scabbard with the other, exerting strength into his arms.

“Stop it, hurry stop it, there will be a disaster, do not pull...” Xiao Lou cried out in panic, because at that moment, he clearly saw that there was suddenly a slight gap between the hilt and the scabbard.

He really could pull out the blade.

How was that possible?

Xiao Lou’s mind went blank for a moment. He was unable to think of a reason why this person had the ability to pull out the blade. The huge shock caused him to scream out in panic.

But the next moment, he stayed where he was dumbfounded.

Because Ye Qingyu had not really pulled out the blade. Instead was quietly standing in the same place, letting go of the handle of the blade, and with a mischievous smile, casually swung his arm, throwing the curved black blade back over to him.

Xiao Lou subconsciously caught the curved blade.

“The [Listening to Spring Rain at Night], Xiao Lou... No matter what you come to the imperial capital for, the era of sects will never return... You are a person with a story, but I do not want your story, and my persistence to collide. I have returned your blade to you. We will fight again when you have the ability to unsheathe your blade.”

Ye Qingyu smiled and turned away from the martial arts battleground.

After a careful examination and interaction with the power of the curved black blade, Ye Qingyu was absolutely certain that this Xiao Lou must be the descendant of a large influential ancient sect from the era of sects. A person like him, appearing around Yu Feiyan, just what did it signify?

It seems that the imperial capital is deeper than he had imagined.

Ye Qingyu came to Xing’er’s side, quietly standing behind her.

And in the distance, Xiao Lou was trembling with an uncontainable fury, his hands were tightly clasped around the hilt of his blade, his knuckles were going pale and protruding out, as if his entire body would soon explode like an active volcano...

But he didn’t in the end.

He took a deep look at Ye Qingyu’s face, as if to engrave this face in the depths of his soul, and then slowly turned, the curved black blade in his arms. He stepped away from the martial arts battle ground, sinking into the distant ship’s cabin.

The sharp piercing wind blew past the battle flag causing it to flutter loudly.

The noise of the fluttering flag made the ship seemed quieter.

When Ye Qingyu walked over to Xing’er’s side, a bright smile made its way across her delicate and beautiful face. She was sitting on the chair and did not speak, but her eyes and brows were exposing her mood.

Yu Feiyan stood up smiling.

His gaze swept back and forth between Ye Qingyu and Xing’er, like a father looking at his daughter and son-in-law, the more he looked the more satisfied he was, finally jokingly said, “Haha, little boyfriend defeated Xiao Lou, this girl is so happy that her mouth is almost going to split open... How about it, the gift that Uncle gave you is pretty good right? If your little boyfriend wants to soar in the imperial capital, then he must slowly become well-known. This battle, consider it as a small gift from Uncle.”

There was suddenly a complex expression that flickered across her eyes and brows because of this sentence. It very soon disappeared and she resumed her previous complexion.

She shook her head, then jumped to her feet, clapping her hands. “Uncle’s gif makes the receiver feel a bit apprehensive. If you continue to give such gifts, Xing’er would be afraid to accept it.”

This was clearly a mockery more than a thank you.

It was not even just mockery.

There was a trace of hostility.

There are many people living in the imperial capital, but those that dared to use this tone to talk to the Apex Prince can be counted with one’s ten fingers. If it was another person, she would have long been dead.

But Yu Feiyan completely disregarded the mockery of Xing’er’s words, his face still kind and amiable. He helplessly shook his head, and then quietly looked at Xing’er, looking into the girl’s eyes. The prince’s face was still gentle and unprecedented calm. He gazed at her for a good while, then as though he thought of something, let out a long sigh.

This long sigh, what meaning did it have?

But everyone in the audience that heard this long sigh, their heart suddenly sank, and even the bright sky that was lit by the blazing sun seemed sad for a moment.

Xing’er was taken aback.

She lowered her head slightly, as though realizing something. She twirled strands of her long black hair around her finger, and then suddenly lost interest, bit her lip and said, “Uncle, since you have seen us now, I have something to do, I have to go...”

Yu Feiyan nodded.

“Girl, the children of the Yu clan, what can they not endure? You have left the imperial capital for too long, you don’t know what the imperial capital is like now. You heard some rumours when you came back, which caused some misunderstanding between us. This, I do not blame you, it takes a long road to know the strength of a horse. One day, you will know, who is really good to you,” he said with a tone of such deep meaning.

Xing’er did not speak.

Under Yu Feiyan’s gaze, she stretched out her slender hand and grasped Ye Qingyu’s huge hand, walked forward a few steps, when their figures flashed, and the two people turned to streams of light, disappearing from this place.

Yu Feiyan silently watched this scene. His sword-like eyebrows were raised slightly, but he did not say anything.

He stood quietly for a very long while.

The guests were looking at the Apex Prince with very strange eyes.

Comparing the Prince today and him at other times, the difference was very huge. This does not match up with the resolute, dignified and decisive image of the Apex Prince, but more like an inferior and lame elder.

The Prince seemed to particularly favour the wilful and unruly Princess Xing’er and spoiled her. Even the little sovereign prince did not have such a treatment given to him.

“Prince, Prince...” A slim, middle-aged adviser was slowly approaching and whispering.

“Ah... Oh, what’s the matter?” Yu Feiyan was spaced out for a moment

“The battle between that boy and Xiao Lou today, do we need to...” The adviser carefully worded his sentence.

Yu Feiyan’s eyes were clear and calm.

Almost at this moment, he had immediately restored the former glare that was like a tiger eyeing its prey, the manner and aura that made countless people fear had reappeared on this person.

The corners of his mouth drew back in a smile as he replied, “I know what you mean, but do not hide it. Also spread the message out. I said that I will give Xing’er a gift, of course I have to send it. As for Xiao Lou... let him slowly think about it. There is no such thing as an undefeated person, if he figures this out, he can go find the boy to win back his loss.”

……

The airship, travelling at the speed of flowing light, was fast as lightning in the sky.

Xing’er had already released Ye Qingyu’s hand.

The sky was very blue.

The wind was very strong.

Ever since returning onto the airship, she had remained silent.

For the past ten minutes, she had been sitting at the front of the deck, legs stretched in the air, gently swaying side to side and humming a very nice tune...

The strong winds lifted the young girl’s black hair, flickering like a black flame, radiating an indescribable beauty.

“Where are we going?”

Ye Qingyu finally couldn’t resist asking.

“Pfff” Xing’er burst out laughing, then turned around and cast a glance at Ye Qingyu. “I thought you would be immersed in the victory of winning against Xiao Lou and won’t bother to ask this.”

Ye Qingyu’s face darkened. “That’s nothing to be proud of...”

“Hee hee, pretend to be a victim after gaining an advantage. If this spreads out, you would immediately become a famous person in the Jianghu of the imperial capital, you would be absolutely well known.”

“Am I not famous enough now?”

“Oh... you’re right.” Xing’er also had to admit that. Ye Qingyu had really caused a storm in the imperial capital these days. She smiled, “It seems you have awakened... The place that we’re going to next, you would never guess, it is the Imperial Ancestral Temple.”

Ye Qingyu gasped out without thinking, became speechless from astonishment, and then stuttered, “What what? What did you say? Imperial Ancestral Temple? The Offering Temple?”

Xing’er stared wide-eyed at Ye Qingyu. “Yes, what? Can’t? Your incredibly astonished look seems a little strange...”

Ye Qingyu did not speak.

But he suppressed the excitement and quietly said to himself: the opportunity really came, but isn’t this a bit too sudden?
