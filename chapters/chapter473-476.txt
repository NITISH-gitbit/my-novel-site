Chapter 473:


Chapter 493, Martial arts foundation is destroyed?
In a split second, the fierce demon and beasts that came rushing out of the Central Domain Gate, suddenly like the tide, shook the air, emitting a thunder-like rumble.
“Brother, be careful.”
Ximen Yeshui blocked in front of Ye Qingyu at the first moment.
Others, including Wen Wan, Jin Ling’er, and Bai Yuanxing also shielded Ye Qingyu at the first moment and dared not relax in the slightest.
Ye Qingyu did not know whether to cry or laugh.
These days, by refining his physical body with the [True Will of the Sky Dragon], constantly refining the buried and concealed energy within his body, he had made enormous progress. Even till now, even he himself was not aware of the strength that his physical body had reached.
It was very frightening anyway.
But because it was very difficult for the strength of one’s physical body to show fluctuation, and at most there was just vigorous blood and qi, very few people could judge the strength of the opponent by the strength of their physical body.
After all, formation yuan qi was the mainstream martial arts in Heaven Wasteland Domain.
In a worldly view, even if the strength of the physical body was incredibly powerful, it was considered to be a lower branch of cultivation. No matter how strong one’s physical strength was, they were unable to fly into the sky or escape underground, and could not operate spiritual weapons, Dao weapons and treasured objects.
When encountering a yuan qi martial artist expert, they would not have any advantage.
So no one was able to perceive the true power of Ye Qingyu.
The more important reason was that Ye Qingyu, through the [True Will of the Sky Dragon], could hide his blood and qi.
The Ye Qingyu at this moment, from the surface, was just a four or five Spirit spring little expert. Everyone thought that the Divine Punishment had destroyed his martial arts foundation.
In the eyes of everyone, even Jin Ling’er, Bai Yuanxing and other people were stronger than Ye Qingyu at this moment.
So seeing that there was a strange change appearing, everyone’s first reaction was to protect Ye Qingyu.
Ye Qingyu also had to cooperate and not attack.
Opposite.
Hu hu hu!
In the great Domain Gate, red-black demonic beasts like a tidal wave came roaring out. The numerous amount of them simply made people’s heart palpitate violently and numbing their scalp.
“These are space-time beasts... A kind of demonic matter that wanders the gaps of space-time, it seems that the appearance of the Central Domain Gate had accidentally triggered a nest of the space-time beasts!”
Yu Junhan very quickly came to the conclusion.
In the space-time gap, there was no light source and food or water. It was impossible for ordinary creatures to survive, and even the strongest martial artist would not survive for long.
But the changes of heaven and earth were mysterious, and could produce this kind of violent and fierce evil monsters. They wandered the torrent of time and space, devouring all living creatures and dead objects that entered into the flow of space-time, like a space-time scavenger, consuming everything.
These demon things did not have intelligence, only the instinct of killing and swallowing. Under undisturbed conditions, they would be in a self-sealing state of cultivation, as though they were dead.
Once awakened by the space-time gap or space-time fluctuation, they would immediately go crazy, frantically engulfing objects that were drawn into the space-time torrent.
This was one of the reasons why the space-time torrent was frightening.
It seemed that this time, it was the emergence of the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s Central Domain Gate and [Domain’s Heavenly Wall] that alarmed a group of self-sealing space-time demonic beasts, and caused them to crash their way through the Domain Gate.
Once Yu Junhan finished her words, the crowd all suddenly understood.
If this was true, then it was a lot more reassuring.
At least it was not the invasion of demons from some other realms.
Everyone that was present was an expert of experts, as soon as they struck back there were internal energy light flames crushing the space-time demonic matters into smithereens.
Ye Qingyu was constantly pulled back by Jin Ling’er and Bai Yunaxing to a safe area.
The battle came suddenly, but went by even faster.
In less than the time to burn an incense, it was over.
In the vast Central Domain Gate, space elements were gradually disappearing from the mirror-like surface. The giant gate once again quietened down, without the slightest fluctuation of power, as if nothing had happened.
Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
During this period of time, everyone was almost going crazy because of the Central Domain Gate.
“Stay on the alert, I believe that there will be creatures from other domains coming soon!”
Yu Junhan uttered with a serious expression as before.
……
For the next few days, everything was calm.
But the atmosphere was tenser than before.
Everyone’s nerves were stretched tight, no one dared to be careless in the slightest. The elite imperial soldiers outside were also fully prepared and set for battle, lying down in their armour. The formations everywhere were operating at all times, showing no hesitation in using up the energy of origin crystals.
Right Minister Lin Zheng suggested Ye Qingyu and other people to temporarily leave Light City for a safer place.
This was of course for safety reasons.
Ye Qingyu after a brief thought, told Jin Ling’er, Bai Yuanxing, Mother Qu and other people to move out of the hundred miles within Light City, while he himself remained behind.
Yu Junhan agreed to this plan.
Right Minister was a little helpless.
The original intention of his proposal was of course, mainly for the safety of Ye Qingyu. In the eyes of an ambitious and ruthless character like Lin Zheng, the importance of Jin Ling’er, Bai Yuanxing, Mother Wu put together, compared to Ye Qingyu, was miles apart.
But in the face of Ye Qingyu’s insistence, there was nothing that Lin Zheng could do.
Next, another one month had passed.
The Central Domain Gate remained quiet as before.
Someone suggested that they might as well actively attack, enter the [Boundary Heaven Wall] with the divine class Origin crystal, and casually open up a passage to enter other realms for investigation, which would be much better than passively waiting.
But the proposal was denied.
While Ye Qingyu, in this period of time, was still constantly activating the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] to train his physical body. His strength was frantically rising at a speed unimaginable to ordinary people.
In addition to this, after a period of time of trying, he finally succeeded in entering the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
Not only could he enter, but he could also freely come out.
Of course, it was only achievable by the part of his spirit that had already escaped.
He attempted to gently connect to a power of his mind that was sealed, and spent a lot of time to observe the vast ancient copper murals inside the [Cloud Top Cauldron]...
Among the murals, there was an extremely strange and mysterious power.
Under the intact state of the mind, Ye Qingyu could only just manage to finish studying a complete mural in one day before he gets dizzy and confused, entering into a state of excessive energy consumption.
However, after he recovered, Ye Qingyu found that the strength and depth of his mind had also significantly increased.
“It seems that by looking at the murals, one can refine and strengthen the power of the mind?”
This discovery was a pleasant surprise to Ye Qingyu.
If this was really the case, then as long as he constantly observed the murals here and refined the mind, would he be able to constantly strengthen and expand the power of the mind? Sooner or later, one day he could break through the restrictions of the [Cloud Top Cauldron]?
In addition to this, Ye Qingyu also discovered some clues to the current state of his body.
Currently in his dantian barren world, an originally surging and howling yuan qi river was now in a calm state. There were no waves above the river surface, and was as peaceful as light. The yuan qi river had became stagnant water, lacking any vitality.
This was because there was not enough energy to activate the mind and consciousness.
And of the 100 surging Spirit springs before, there were only three Spirit springs remaining that were bubbling out yuan qi clear spring water.
The other 97 Spirit springs were equally in some sort of sealed state, and were incomparably silent.
But Ye Qingyu could tell that, these Spirit spring mouths were not dead or drained, rather in a temporary static state.
And of the three awakened Spirit springs, one of them was gently nourishing the [Cloud Top Cauldron], another nourishing the [Fiendgod Titled Chart], and in the other eye was some bits and bobs, such as the remnant of the [Little Shang] sword, as well as some parts of the [Beheading Wind] sword.
Before, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and [Fiendgod Titled Chart] were living in the high altitude of the dantian barren world, emitting brilliance, like the sun and moon, and unable to integrate into the Spirit springs, but it was now taking the initiative to go in.
Ye Qingyu was deep in thought, when he vaguely realized something.
It must have been that his cultivation and physical strength were not enough before, so the Spirit springs could not accommodate the two great mysterious treasures. Now that his physical body had been reborn, it could finally accept them.
Moreover, Ye Qingyu also found that he could summon the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to his hands, and change its size at will.
Of course, that was all.
That day, when he was bombarded by the Divine Punishment, it must have activated some sort of formation within this ancient copper cauldron, triggering the copper cauldron to undergo changes.
Ye Qingyu could have opened it before, but now it would not open at all.
“It can only be summoned, turned big or small, what’s the use in that? Can’t refine pills, can’t store things...” Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry. “Could it be turned to a weapon, to smash people?”
The copper cauldron kept growing bigger and then smaller.
Ye Qingyu held one of the copper legs, waving it about.
There was a sudden gust of wind.
Impressively powerful.
“Hey, you don’t say, the weight of this copper cauldron is not heavy or light, it is perfect. If it really was used to smash people, it is not impossible!”
Ye Qingyu’s eyes lit up, he really was tempted.
The copper cauldron was heavy and hard, that not even the Heavenly Punishment could split it, then it may be assumed that other divine and magical weapons also could not break it.
It was just that using this guy as a weapon seemed a little too shocking.
Ye Qingyu thought it over and put it away.
The days went by one after another.
In other people’s eyes, the strength of Ye Qingyu had not yet recovered, he was still around the four or five Spirit spring yuan qi cultivation level, his blood and qi had deteriorated and was not like how it was before.
Could it be that the martial arts foundation was destroyed and could not be restored?
Many people secretly looked at him with sympathetic eyes.
Ximen Yeshui was grumbling to Ye Qingyu all day long to teach him a secret skill of restoring strength, but he must ask for permission from his master in advance.
So as the guy was trying to contact his master, he told Ye Qingyu to not get angry...
Yu Junhan as usual checked on the condition of Ye Qingyu’s body once a day——She only needed to place her finger on Ye Qingyu’s wrist and operate yuan qi to fully understand the condition of Ye Qingyu’s body like the back of her hand——
Chapter 493, Martial arts foundation is destroyed?
In a split second, the fierce demon and beasts that came rushing out of the Central Domain Gate, suddenly like the tide, shook the air, emitting a thunder-like rumble.

========================================

Chapter 474:


Chapter 494, Snow capital·Imperial Ancestral Temple
She should be the only one that truly understood Ye Qingyu’s real strength.
After so many days had passed, the Central Domain Gate had not undergone much change. Ye Qingyu also became slack.
Now his main thoughts again returned to his own life and past history.
Since Yu Junhan did not tell Ye Qingyu and he did not feel right to ask, his attention began to return to the Imperial Ancestral Temple of the Imperial ancestral land.
From his memory, before his father’s death, he told him that, once his strength reaches the Bitter Sea stage, then he can uncover all the puzzles by going to the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
Now was the time.
Now, Ye Qingyu’s identity was special, because Yu Junhan believed that she was her son, which meant that he was also a part of the Imperial family. Logically speaking, he was also eligible to enter the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
Ye Qingyu decided to act.
On this day, accompanied by Wen Wan, he left the City of Light.
Ye Qingyu was going to find Yu Xiaoxing.
……
“You’re going to the Imperial Ancestral Temple?”
Yu Xiaoxing was a little surprised.
Following Yu Junhan’s words, these days, Yu Xiaoxing had begun to reveal her female identity. Gradually, some of the higher-level officers of the Imperial military also knew of the real identity of Yu Xiaoxing.
This was the first time that Ye Qingyu came to find Yu Xiaoxing of his own initiative.
So Yu Xiaoxing was very excited.
Since that day, Yu Xiaoxing no longer hid her feelings for Ye Qingyu.
Although there was kinship between them, the Imperial laws and customs do not prohibit the marriage between cousins, and in some large families, this sort of marriage was encouraged, and can increase the cohesiveness of the family.
Yu Xiaoxing was a very magnanimous woman with a masculine personality.
She had always been open and honest, and since it had been revealed so obviously that day, then there was no reason to try to cover it up anymore. It would be better to face everything directly.
“Of course that won’t be a problem, cousin, with your present identity, you are eligible to enter the Imperial Ancestral tTmple... However, this matter, I still should let father know about it first. After all, it is not yet the annual opening day of the Imperial Ancestral Temple.”
Yu Xiaoxing thought about it carefully, before giving an answer.
Ye Qingyu smiled and nodded, “Then I will have to trouble the Crown Princess, as soon as possible would be great.”
Yu Xiaoxing stared at Ye Qingyu, grinning, then she was suddenly struck by a thought and said, “Since it is urgent, then how about this, you can go see father with me now and ask him directly.”
Go see the Snow Emperor?
Ye Qingyu was slightly taken aback. He had not expected Yu Xiaoxing to say this at all.
But in his heart, there was a trace of curiosity floating up.
After all, it was the Snow Emperor.
The highest ruler of the Human Race in Heaven Wasteland Domain.
Once, Ye Qingyu had thought that the Snow Emperor was an unattainable great figure, as unreachable as the deities, but now he unexpectedly had the same blood running through his body as this human emperor...
These days, Snow Emperor had not made an appearance.
The overall situation was taken care of by Yu Junhan.
If he could see the supreme ruler of the Snow Empire... then, why would he say no?
Ye Qingyu nodded in response.
Yu Xiaoxing covered her mouth and smiled.
……
After the time to burn an incense stick.
Imperial Palace.
Back courtyard garden.
It was Ye Qingyu’s first time meeting the ‘legendary’ great figure, the supreme ruler of the empire, the dragon of all people, the most prominent existence of the Human Race in Heaven Wasteland Domain.
Snow Emperor.
“You are the son of Junhan?”
In the garden of lush green plants, winding streams and flowers in full bloom, the tall and sturdy Snow Emperor had a faint smile on his face. His eyes were fixed on Ye Qingyu, and he appeared calm and quiet.
“Your Majesty!”
Ye Qingyu bowed down.
In all honesty, the Snow Emperor was not the same as he had imagined.
He once thought that the emperor of an empire would be dressed in divine armour, as mighty-looking as a dragon, and emanating divine light, like an immortal. When he opens his mouth there would be lotus flowers bursting forth, and he does not eat the food of common mortals.
But the middle-aged man before him had a solemn appearance, and bronze-coloured skin as though he had suffered the hardships of life. His hair was already grey and between the hair on his temples were strands of silver hair. There was little bold and powerful qi around him, as if he was an ordinary person.
But he also could tell that, when the Snow Emperor was young, he must be a rare, handsome man. The him now, clad in a white cloth robe and casual attire, gave a kind of confident and unrestrained manner.
The people of the Snow Empire’s Imperial family were all handsome men and beautiful women.
Yu Junhan and Yu Xiaoxing were rare beauties, and prince Yu Feiyan was also a well-known handsome man.
In appearance, the Snow Emperor was no less inferior.
It was just that his condition did not seem to be very good, and when he smiled, there were wrinkles around the corner of his mouth and eyes. He looked more like a veteran soldier who had been practicing martial arts for a long time but had now deteriorated to an ordinary cultivation level.
“Ah, I’ve wanted to see you for a long time.” Snow Emperor raised his hands, indicating Ye Qingyu to get up. “I remember I held you when you were born. In the blink of an eye, so many years have passed.”
Upon hearing these words, Ye Qingyu couldn’t help his heart trembling
Things were getting more and more confusing now.
Whether the Snow Emperor had held him when he was a baby or not, Ye Qingyu was not a divine child, so it was simply impossible for him to remember.
But the problem was that, ever since he began to form memories, he had always been in Deer City, and in his memories, his parents...
For a moment, Ye Qingyu didn’t know what to say.
“Now looking closely, your appearance, and that person’s looks...” Snow Emperor’s breathing was not at all stable and his voice was faint.
Ye Qingyu guessed that it was perhaps a price that he had to pay in order to close the Central Domain Gate. His injury must have not fully recovered from that day.
Perhaps because seeing Ye Qingyu had made him think of something, Snow Emperor’s gaze fell on the woods outside of the pavilion, his eyes becoming distant and blurred, without any focus. It was obvious that he had sunk into distant memories.
Ye Qingyu did not want to disturb him.
Yu Xiaoxing was quietly standing on one side.
A long while had past before the Snow Emperor was finally woken up from the distant memories. He gently gasped, and shifted his gaze back at Ye Qingyu, a strange light flickering in his eyes, as though he had suddenly remembered something.
“What did Xing’er say just now, you want to go to the Imperial Ancestral Temple?” he asked Ye Qingyu.
Ye Qingyu nodded. “I ask for your Majesty’s permission.”
Snow Emperor flipped his hand over, when a dragon scale Imperial seal emerged among a flash of golden light, floating over to Ye Qingyu. “Go, back then this Ancestral Temple was to... Hoho, calculating the time, you should go to see it.”
Ye Qingyu blankly received the dragon scale Imperial seal.
Snow Emperor’s words had something deeper held within it.
But Ye Qingyu didn’t understand what he meant.
Once Ye Qingyu got out of the Imperial palace, he went on the yellow airship of Yu Xiaoxing, and was heading to the Imperial ancestral land, he was still thinking about this problem. It was obvious that the Snow Emperor knew something, but he did not say it out.
About an hour later, the mysterious yellow airship passed through the outskirts of the Ancestral Temple area, entering into the real small world of the ancestral land.
According to the rules, all the guards on the mysterious yellow ship cannot continue any further.
Yu Xiaoxing and Ye Qingyu got off the ship, and only after a number of inspections from guards of the ancestral land did they head toward the center of the small world.
Having been here once before, Ye Qingyu possessed a vivid memory of everything here.
Beautiful sceneries and abundant spiritual aura.
Walking through the hills and mountains.
This time, the two people entered the ancestral land with a completely different identity from the last time. One was declared to be the current crown Prince, and the other was suspected to possess royal blood. It was naturally different from the last time. They were a lot more relaxed, and their speed was also a lot faster.
In a short period of time, they passed by Yu Junhan’s residence, which they had gone to last time.
But Ye Qingyu’s mind was entirely on the Imperial Ancestral Temple, eager to unravel the mysteries in his heart, so he did not have the mood to take a trip down memory lane.
Another half an hour passed.
Finally, they arrived at the central area of the Imperial ancestral land.
The mountains were stacked wrong, and the sword-like peaks were like a forest.
Jade-like waterfalls dropped over the edge of the mountain peaks, mist rising around, like the white mist of a paradise, shrouding the mountains and woods. There were rainbows everywhere, and all kinds of immortal birds and auspicious animals were flapping their wings high in the clouds. Between the clouds it was like a haven of peace.
Yu Xiaoxing played a jade flute.
Two huge beautiful red-crowned cranes descended from the sky, landing in front of the two.
“The main peak is covered with formations that the unparalleled War God set up back then, sealing everything. We cannot enter through ordinary methods, so to get to the Imperial Ancestral Temple, we must ride the white crane.”
Yu Xiaoxing excitedly jumped on the back of a crane, her slender, fair hand like a newly peeled white onion stroked the head of the red-crowned crane, and as though it could understand, let out a cry and soared.
Ye Qingyu was also a little curious, jumped onto the back of another crane.
In Ye Qingyu’s mind, although this crane was very fast, piercing across the void like a lightning arrow, it was unexpectedly steady and surprisingly stable. While it was flapping its wings, it would form a layer of pale blue light arc around its body, blocking the fierce and cold air in the sky!
The feeling of riding a crane was incredibly wonderful, and felt as though he was walking on clouds like an immortal.
There were many ancient myths and legends in Heaven Wasteland Domain. There was a free and unfettered celestial being travelling between heaven and earth on a crane, detached from all, living carefree and without worries. This person was the envy of everyone.
Ye Qingyu did not think that he would have such an experience today.
White clouds whistled past at their sides.
Yu Xiaoxing all of a sudden started laughing excitedly, “Hee hee, when I was small, every time I attended the Imperial ancestral ceremony, I enjoyed riding cranes and soaring into the sky the most...”
Ye Qingyu did not speak.
This crane’s back was very wide, enough to sit 3-5 people, and for some reason, Ye Qingyu felt as though his mind and that of the crane was linked.
As soon as a thought surfaced in his mind, the crane seemed like it understood and would perform the flight trajectory and speed that Ye Qingyu wanted.
“It would be nice to have a crane like that following me about,” Ye Qingyu thought.
His current yuan qi and cultivation was temporarily sealed, and although he could fly, the yuan qi of three Spirit springs was not enough to support long-distance flight. But whether it was in speed or height, there was no way he could be compared to Bitter Sea experts.
If he had a crane as a means of transportation, that would be absolutely eye-catching.
While deep in thought, the main peak was almost within reach.
The crane descended.
Ye Qingyu could see at once that, sat on the main peak, was the Imperial Ancestral Temple——
Chapter 494, Snow capital·Imperial Ancestral Temple
She should be the only one that truly understood Ye Qingyu’s real strength.
After so many days had passed, the Central Domain Gate had not undergone much change. Ye Qingyu also became slack.
Now his main thoughts again returned to his own life and past history.
Since Yu Junhan did not tell Ye Qingyu and he did not feel right to ask, his attention began to return to the Imperial Ancestral Temple of the Imperial ancestral land.
From his memory, before his father’s death, he told him that, once his strength reaches the Bitter Sea stage, then he can uncover all the puzzles by going to the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
Now was the time.
Now, Ye Qingyu’s identity was special, because Yu Junhan believed that she was her son, which meant that he was also a part of the Imperial family. Logically speaking, he was also eligible to enter the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
Ye Qingyu decided to act.
On this day, accompanied by Wen Wan, he left the City of Light.
Ye Qingyu was going to find Yu Xiaoxing.
……
“You’re going to the Imperial Ancestral Temple?”
Yu Xiaoxing was a little surprised.
Following Yu Junhan’s words, these days, Yu Xiaoxing had begun to reveal her female identity. Gradually, some of the higher-level officers of the Imperial military also knew of the real identity of Yu Xiaoxing.
This was the first time that Ye Qingyu came to find Yu Xiaoxing of his own initiative.
So Yu Xiaoxing was very excited.
Since that day, Yu Xiaoxing no longer hid her feelings for Ye Qingyu.
Although there was kinship between them, the Imperial laws and customs do not prohibit the marriage between cousins, and in some large families, this sort of marriage was encouraged, and can increase the cohesiveness of the family.
Yu Xiaoxing was a very magnanimous woman with a masculine personality.
She had always been open and honest, and since it had been revealed so obviously that day, then there was no reason to try to cover it up anymore. It would be better to face everything directly.
“Of course that won’t be a problem, cousin, with your present identity, you are eligible to enter the Imperial Ancestral tTmple... However, this matter, I still should let father know about it first. After all, it is not yet the annual opening day of the Imperial Ancestral Temple.”
Yu Xiaoxing thought about it carefully, before giving an answer.
Ye Qingyu smiled and nodded, “Then I will have to trouble the Crown Princess, as soon as possible would be great.”
Yu Xiaoxing stared at Ye Qingyu, grinning, then she was suddenly struck by a thought and said, “Since it is urgent, then how about this, you can go see father with me now and ask him directly.”
Go see the Snow Emperor?
Ye Qingyu was slightly taken aback. He had not expected Yu Xiaoxing to say this at all.
But in his heart, there was a trace of curiosity floating up.
After all, it was the Snow Emperor.
The highest ruler of the Human Race in Heaven Wasteland Domain.
Once, Ye Qingyu had thought that the Snow Emperor was an unattainable great figure, as unreachable as the deities, but now he unexpectedly had the same blood running through his body as this human emperor...
These days, Snow Emperor had not made an appearance.
The overall situation was taken care of by Yu Junhan.
If he could see the supreme ruler of the Snow Empire... then, why would he say no?
Ye Qingyu nodded in response.
Yu Xiaoxing covered her mouth and smiled.
……
After the time to burn an incense stick.
Imperial Palace.
Back courtyard garden.
It was Ye Qingyu’s first time meeting the ‘legendary’ great figure, the supreme ruler of the empire, the dragon of all people, the most prominent existence of the Human Race in Heaven Wasteland Domain.
Snow Emperor.
“You are the son of Junhan?”
In the garden of lush green plants, winding streams and flowers in full bloom, the tall and sturdy Snow Emperor had a faint smile on his face. His eyes were fixed on Ye Qingyu, and he appeared calm and quiet.
“Your Majesty!”
Ye Qingyu bowed down.
In all honesty, the Snow Emperor was not the same as he had imagined.
He once thought that the emperor of an empire would be dressed in divine armour, as mighty-looking as a dragon, and emanating divine light, like an immortal. When he opens his mouth there would be lotus flowers bursting forth, and he does not eat the food of common mortals.
But the middle-aged man before him had a solemn appearance, and bronze-coloured skin as though he had suffered the hardships of life. His hair was already grey and between the hair on his temples were strands of silver hair. There was little bold and powerful qi around him, as if he was an ordinary person.
But he also could tell that, when the Snow Emperor was young, he must be a rare, handsome man. The him now, clad in a white cloth robe and casual attire, gave a kind of confident and unrestrained manner.
The people of the Snow Empire’s Imperial family were all handsome men and beautiful women.
Yu Junhan and Yu Xiaoxing were rare beauties, and prince Yu Feiyan was also a well-known handsome man.
In appearance, the Snow Emperor was no less inferior.
It was just that his condition did not seem to be very good, and when he smiled, there were wrinkles around the corner of his mouth and eyes. He looked more like a veteran soldier who had been practicing martial arts for a long time but had now deteriorated to an ordinary cultivation level.
“Ah, I’ve wanted to see you for a long time.” Snow Emperor raised his hands, indicating Ye Qingyu to get up. “I remember I held you when you were born. In the blink of an eye, so many years have passed.”
Upon hearing these words, Ye Qingyu couldn’t help his heart trembling
Things were getting more and more confusing now.
Whether the Snow Emperor had held him when he was a baby or not, Ye Qingyu was not a divine child, so it was simply impossible for him to remember.
But the problem was that, ever since he began to form memories, he had always been in Deer City, and in his memories, his parents...
For a moment, Ye Qingyu didn’t know what to say.
“Now looking closely, your appearance, and that person’s looks...” Snow Emperor’s breathing was not at all stable and his voice was faint.
Ye Qingyu guessed that it was perhaps a price that he had to pay in order to close the Central Domain Gate. His injury must have not fully recovered from that day.
Perhaps because seeing Ye Qingyu had made him think of something, Snow Emperor’s gaze fell on the woods outside of the pavilion, his eyes becoming distant and blurred, without any focus. It was obvious that he had sunk into distant memories.
Ye Qingyu did not want to disturb him.
Yu Xiaoxing was quietly standing on one side.
A long while had past before the Snow Emperor was finally woken up from the distant memories. He gently gasped, and shifted his gaze back at Ye Qingyu, a strange light flickering in his eyes, as though he had suddenly remembered something.
“What did Xing’er say just now, you want to go to the Imperial Ancestral Temple?” he asked Ye Qingyu.
Ye Qingyu nodded. “I ask for your Majesty’s permission.”
Snow Emperor flipped his hand over, when a dragon scale Imperial seal emerged among a flash of golden light, floating over to Ye Qingyu. “Go, back then this Ancestral Temple was to... Hoho, calculating the time, you should go to see it.”
Ye Qingyu blankly received the dragon scale Imperial seal.
Snow Emperor’s words had something deeper held within it.
But Ye Qingyu didn’t understand what he meant.
Once Ye Qingyu got out of the Imperial palace, he went on the yellow airship of Yu Xiaoxing, and was heading to the Imperial ancestral land, he was still thinking about this problem. It was obvious that the Snow Emperor knew something, but he did not say it out.
About an hour later, the mysterious yellow airship passed through the outskirts of the Ancestral Temple area, entering into the real small world of the ancestral land.
According to the rules, all the guards on the mysterious yellow ship cannot continue any further.
Yu Xiaoxing and Ye Qingyu got off the ship, and only after a number of inspections from guards of the ancestral land did they head toward the center of the small world.
Having been here once before, Ye Qingyu possessed a vivid memory of everything here.
Beautiful sceneries and abundant spiritual aura.
Walking through the hills and mountains.
This time, the two people entered the ancestral land with a completely different identity from the last time. One was declared to be the current crown Prince, and the other was suspected to possess royal blood. It was naturally different from the last time. They were a lot more relaxed, and their speed was also a lot faster.
In a short period of time, they passed by Yu Junhan’s residence, which they had gone to last time.
But Ye Qingyu’s mind was entirely on the Imperial Ancestral Temple, eager to unravel the mysteries in his heart, so he did not have the mood to take a trip down memory lane.
Another half an hour passed.
Finally, they arrived at the central area of the Imperial ancestral land.
The mountains were stacked wrong, and the sword-like peaks were like a forest.
Jade-like waterfalls dropped over the edge of the mountain peaks, mist rising around, like the white mist of a paradise, shrouding the mountains and woods. There were rainbows everywhere, and all kinds of immortal birds and auspicious animals were flapping their wings high in the clouds. Between the clouds it was like a haven of peace.
Yu Xiaoxing played a jade flute.
Two huge beautiful red-crowned cranes descended from the sky, landing in front of the two.
“The main peak is covered with formations that the unparalleled War God set up back then, sealing everything. We cannot enter through ordinary methods, so to get to the Imperial Ancestral Temple, we must ride the white crane.”
Yu Xiaoxing excitedly jumped on the back of a crane, her slender, fair hand like a newly peeled white onion stroked the head of the red-crowned crane, and as though it could understand, let out a cry and soared.
Ye Qingyu was also a little curious, jumped onto the back of another crane.
In Ye Qingyu’s mind, although this crane was very fast, piercing across the void like a lightning arrow, it was unexpectedly steady and surprisingly stable. While it was flapping its wings, it would form a layer of pale blue light arc around its body, blocking the fierce and cold air in the sky!
The feeling of riding a crane was incredibly wonderful, and felt as though he was walking on clouds like an immortal.
There were many ancient myths and legends in Heaven Wasteland Domain. There was a free and unfettered celestial being travelling between heaven and earth on a crane, detached from all, living carefree and without worries. This person was the envy of everyone.
Ye Qingyu did not think that he would have such an experience today.
White clouds whistled past at their sides.
Yu Xiaoxing all of a sudden started laughing excitedly, “Hee hee, when I was small, every time I attended the Imperial ancestral ceremony, I enjoyed riding cranes and soaring into the sky the most...”
Ye Qingyu did not speak.
This crane’s back was very wide, enough to sit 3-5 people, and for some reason, Ye Qingyu felt as though his mind and that of the crane was linked.
As soon as a thought surfaced in his mind, the crane seemed like it understood and would perform the flight trajectory and speed that Ye Qingyu wanted.
“It would be nice to have a crane like that following me about,” Ye Qingyu thought.
His current yuan qi and cultivation was temporarily sealed, and although he could fly, the yuan qi of three Spirit springs was not enough to support long-distance flight. But whether it was in speed or height, there was no way he could be compared to Bitter Sea experts.
If he had a crane as a means of transportation, that would be absolutely eye-catching.
While deep in thought, the main peak was almost within reach.
The crane descended.
Ye Qingyu could see at once that, sat on the main peak, was the Imperial Ancestral Temple——

Chapter 475:


Chapter 495 - The ancestral tool is broken?
On the summit of the ancestral peak, under the endless illumination of the sunlight, a dark imposing shrine was standing tall.
The Yu clan advocated the colour black. Besides the bright yellow-coloured attire that descendants of the imperial family usually wore in order to symbolize the imperial spirit, whether it was imperial guard or official, their clothing and armour were all mainly black.
Therefore, the Imperial Ancestral Temple was just as Ye Qingyu had expected. It was indeed a black stone building.
The crane descended.
Ye Qingyu jumped to the ground.
“Thanks, fellow.” Ye Qingyu smiled, stroked the big crane’s back, and then took out some of the immortal dew
spirit fruit
from his storage for the two cranes.
“Ao…”
The crane let out a long cry, dancing merrily.
Especially the one that was carrying Ye Qingyu. It rubbed its head against Ye Qingyu’s arm to express its thanks. Its gesture was very intimate. Then it took the immortal dew fruit and flew off.
“They seem to like you very much,” Yu Xiaoxing said with a smile.
Ye Qingyu smiled without saying anything, and turned towards the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
The Imperial Ancestral Temple was in the central area of the Yu clan’s ancestral land, which was said to commemorate the ancestors of the Yu clan. It was regarded as an important place of the clan’s cohesiveness and imposing authority.
According to Yu Xiaoxing, besides the Yu Clan’s annual Imperial Memorial ceremony, the Imperial Ancestral Temple was always closed.
There were no such people as gatekeeper experts in the ancestral temple.
A spacious road, divided into four levels, led up to the temple.
On both sides of the road, there were tall, black warrior statutes more than 10 meters tall. They were vivid and lifelike, wielding swords and other various weapons, and looking down on the road.
Upon closer observation, each warrior statue had their brows furrowed and their eyes blazing. The expression on their face was grave and stern, as if divine light would shoot out from their eyes and they would jump up to kill all outsiders that dared to break into here at any time.
Ye Qingyu walked across the road in big strides.
Although his mind was currently damaged, he still could clearly sense that, in this main peak of the ancestral land, there was a majestic and abundant power contained within, protecting the temple and suppressing the yuan energy of any experts that set foot on the main peak.
“Even if a Heaven Ascension expert was here, I’m afraid he will be suppressed to the ordinary martial level.” Ye Qingyu was inwardly afraid.
He could feel that the power within his body was changing, the last three Spirit springs, in such an environment, were beginning to become quiet and still.
But his physical strength was not at all suppressed.
They walked along the road and came to the entrance of the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
The outside of the Imperial Ancestral Temple of the Yu clan was neat and solemn, and there was nothing particularly unusual. On all four sides, the black rocks gave a calm feeling, and whether it was the round pillars or the brown walls, there wasn’t any sort of writing or carved patterns. The natural lines on the rocks, despite being through hundred years of wind and sun, were still smooth as before.
Ye Qingyu glanced up.
For some reason, he vaguely felt that the shape and appearance of this Imperial Ancestral Temple was unexpectedly somewhat similar to the [Light Palace].
And what made Ye Qingyu feel even more strange was that the main entrance to the temple was opened widely and there was no door. It was like a huge corridor, leading straight into the main hall.
The wind whistled.
A gust of strong wind swept into the temple.
“In the little world of the ancestral land, there are no guards and no one protecting the temple. For so many years, only Aunt Han and Aunt Heng were allowed to reside in the ancestral land. It is said that back then, Grandfather said that the ancestral land is the center of the Yu clan’s destiny and must not allow ordinary people to invade here. It requires nourishment from natural air, the essence of the sun and moon, immortal birds and spiritual beasts to maintain the destiny of the Yu clan...”
Yu Xiaoxing explained.
Ye Qingyu nodded slightly.
He didn’t know much about the idea of destiny.
But seeing that, in this small world of the Imperial family, the spiritual energy was so abundant, there were beautiful sceneries and a faint magical air, he thought that there must be a reason why they did so.
But Ye Qingyu was in no mood to think about this.
He slowly came to the entrance of the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
His heart suddenly became even more tense.
His father’s last words, the truth of everything, was it finally going to be completely solved?
Ye Qingyu could clearly feel that the brass military medal was producing an intense heat, like a lava, and a feeling of impatience was spreading out.
After a slight hesitation, Ye Qingyu looked at Yu Xiaoxing and said, “I want to go in alone, can I?”
Yu Xiaoxing, without giving it a thought, nodded. “Of course, then I’ll wait for cousin outside.”
“Thank you,”
Ye Qingyu said in a very serious voice.
In many ways, Yu Xiaoxing was very clever.
The Crown Princess, Her Highness smiled. Her smiling face was like a flower, extremely beautiful and pure.
Once Ye Qingyu finished speaking, he slowly stepped forward with timid interest and eventually entered the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
……
“This is the inside of the Imperial Ancestral Temple.”
Ye Qingyu was incredibly astonished.
He originally thought that in this little world, which was so important to the Yu clan and which was so heavily guarded, then the inside of the Imperial Ancestral Temple should be magnificent, full of a variety of formation prohibitions and space formations, or many other things such as illusion formations...
But everything was completely beyond his expectation.
Because as he made his way along the corridor, there were only simple and unadorned walls, ancient colours and no unnecessary decorations. There was no incense burner, altar, sacrificial tripod or anything at all.
The light in the hall was dim.
But Ye Qingyu could still see everything inside.
The inside was shabby and simple, almost like an old temple that had been abandoned for countless years. All the things have been cleared away, the walls were completely empty, and the ground was covered with a thick layer of dust.
Ye Qingyu walked along, leaving a series of clear footprints behind.
He took out the brass medal.
A heavenly fire-like scorching heat was emitting from the brass medal, a faint brass-coloured brilliance flashing above, and ripples-like rings of light were floating and drifting out.
Under the stunned gaze of Ye Qingyu, the brass medal suddenly floated up and started to emit a yellow light, leading the way into the depths of the hall.
Ye Qingyu followed.
His heart was beating wildly.
The truth, was it going to be uncovered?
The tangerine-yellow rays of light of the medal illuminated the spacious and empty dim hall.
He walked straight ahead.
Ye Qingyu was more and more shocked as he proceeded.
In the Imperial Ancestral Temple, there were no objects for offerings, no statues, no memorial tablet, no incense burner, no sacrificial tripod, and not even a praying mat or a chair or anything.
If it was not for that fact that Ye Qingyu knew the Imperial Ancestral Temple was heavily guarded and it was impossible for outsiders to enter, he would have thought that this place had been ransacked and all things had been stolen.
The hall was very deep.
The medal unhurriedly floated forward.
Ye Qingyu, at this moment, held his breath, and
finally
slowly followed behind.
Ye Qingyu did not know whether it was a misconception or not, but he noticed that out of the corner of his eyes, when the yellow light of the medal swept across the inner walls of the temple, it seemed as though there was a mysterious light pattern on the originally dark walls...
But when he looked carefully, he found nothing.
Around half an hour had past.
The floating medal finally slowly came to a stop at the deepest part of the Imperial Ancestral Temple.
An old and broken stone table appeared in Ye Qingyu’s line of sight.
The light blue stone table was missing a corner, the surface was pitted, like it had been corroded by something. Of the four legs, there were two full of cracks, as if they would shatter into pieces at any time, and one that was broken, and the incision was incomparably smooth...
“This is...”
Ye Qingyu couldn’t understand why, at the deepest part of the Imperial Ancestral Temple, an important place of the Snow Empire, there was not a memorial tablet of former ancestors, nor portraits of ancestors or sacrificial vessels, but a worn out bluestone table.
A broken table that even if it was thrown into the slums, no one would pick it up.
Could it be that this stone table was some sort of treasure?
Ye Qingyu, with a puzzled gaze, looked around.
He was now finally able to confirm that there was really nothing else in the huge Imperial Ancestral Temple except for the broken, crumbling bluestone table.
This was so abnormal.
Could it be that for 100 years the object of worship for the Snow Empire’s Imperial family every year was this bluestone table?
Ye Qingyu felt that his brain was not quite enough.
Before his father died, he told him that, as long as he enters the Imperial Ancestral Temple, he could unlock some suspense and solve the mystery.
Now that he was here, how does he solve the mystery?
Ye Qingyu’s gaze fell back on the brass medal that was floating in mid-air.
The medal was emitting a bright yellow light, the light ripples that were constantly moving about was no longer wandering around and were steadily hovering above the broken bluestone table.
Time slowly passed by.
Nothing happened.
Ye Qingyu began to become a little anxious and impatient.
The scene that he was anticipating, or something wonderful, did not appear.
Under the shining light ripples of the medal, the bluestone table gave no reaction at all, as though it was in deep sleep.
“Could it be like drawing blood to prove bloodline, I need to drop blood onto it?”
Ye Qingyu had no idea what to do while waiting, so he thought that he might as well puncture his fingertip and drop blood onto the broken bluestone table.
Drip!
Like a drop of water.
The bead of blood did not disperse, falling directly on the bluestone table.
But it did not penetrate into the stone surface.
Instead, it slid down the tabletop.
The bluestone table did not show the slightest reaction.
Bang!
When that bead of blood dropped onto the ground, producing a heavy, muffled sound, it was like a boulder smashing into the ground. And immediately a small dent had formed on the black stone floor.
Ye Qingyu’s current cultivation level had reached what kind of frightening and powerful level, that a drop of blood could be heavy as a hill. For such a strange scene to appear was not at all surprising.
But the important point was that, following the drop of blood nothing else happened as before.
But with that quake, one of the leg of the originally broken bluestone table was completely snapped off, dropped onto the ground, scattering and rolling away...
Ye Qingyu’s expression suddenly became very strange.
“I... this... broke the ancestral tool of the Yu clan Imperial family?”
Chapter 495 - The ancestral tool is broken?

When that bead of blood dropped onto the ground, producing a heavy, muffled sound, it was like a boulder smashing into the ground. And immediately a small dent had formed on the black stone floor.
Ye Qingyu’s current cultivation level had reached what kind of frightening and powerful level, that a drop of blood could be heavy as a hill. For such a strange scene to appear was not at all surprising.
But the important point was that, following the drop of blood nothing else happened as before.
But with that quake, one of the leg of the originally broken bluestone table was completely snapped off, dropped onto the ground, scattering and rolling away...
Ye Qingyu’s expression suddenly became very strange.
“I... this... broke the ancestral tool of the Yu clan Imperial family?”

Chapter 476:


Chapter 496, Two temple spaces
Ye Qingyu, looking at the broken pieces of the table leg, simply did not know what to say.
What was happening here was completely different from his expectations.
Where was the so-called truth?
His father’s last words could not be a lie.
But why had nothing happened as he stood in the deepest part of the Imperial Ancestral Temple for more than half an hour?
Could it be that he had overlooked something?
Ye Qingyu lowered his head in deep thought, recalling his father’s last words, but it did not provide the slightest clue. It also seemed like his father had not left any similar clues for him.
What went wrong?
Ye Qingyu remained perplexed after pondering over this a hundred times over.
He forcibly suppressed his irritation, drew a deep breath, and simply sat crossed leg in front of the broken bluestone tabletop, operating the nameless breathing technique and began training.
Since he had entered the Imperial Ancestral Temple, he was absolutely unwilling to leave with nothing. He needed to calm down and wait patiently to see if other changes would appear.
Time slowly went by.
Approximately half an hour later, Ye Qingyu opened his eyes again.
Nothing had changed in the hall at all.
Ye Qingyu carefully examined the stone table once more, stroking the stone table surface with the palm of his hand, hoping to find some mystery, but he failed. The stone table was an ordinary bluestone table which did not contain any formation nor was particularly sturdy...
Ye Qingyu had no doubt that if he exerted a little strength, he could easily crush the stone table.
Then he began to observe the walls of the stone temple.
After a whole hour, he finally gave up.
Because there was no mystery on the walls at all.
And the brass medal that was floating above his head had gradually began to lose its brilliance, and eventually returned to its previous appearance, falling and landing on Ye Qingyu’s palm.
It was slightly warm to the touch and was no longer roasting hot as before.
What was going on here?
Ye Qingyu couldn’t help but become a little irritable again.
He was usually a very calm and unimpulsive person. He always liked to have a plan before taking any action, but this time...
It was related to the background of his life, it was his biggest mystery, and also the matter that he most wanted to know after the war of the [Light Palace]. He came here full of confidence that he would find the answer.
Who knew that...
Ye Qingyu retrieved that drop of blood, stood still for a moment, pondering over the matter, before he finally turned around and left the hall.
As he walked out of the hall, Yu Xiaoxiang was seen playing with the two cranes that brought them here to the main peak.
“Cousin, you’ve come out,” Yu Xiaoxing greeted Ye Qingyu with a smile, but very soon noticed that Ye Qingyu’s expression was not right, and her tone changed, “What? Are you all right?”
“I’m fine.” Ye Qingyu smiled, took a deep breath and said, “Xing’er, have you ever been in the Imperial ancestral Temple?”
“I’ve been inside.” Yu Xiaoxing nodded firmly. “When I was small, it was mother who took me to participate in the Imperial ancestral ceremony, then later as I was older I would attend the clan’s annual ceremony... What’s wrong? Cousin, why are you asking?”
Ye Qingyu continued asking, “That... do you know what it looks like inside the Ancestral temple?”
“Ah? Cousin, didn’t you just go in?” Although surprised, Yu Xiaoxing still gave a brief description of the furnishings and decor inside.
Upon hearing what she said he was shocked, as though he was struck by lightning.
“What? You said... in the Ancestral temple, there are nine altars, ancestral memorial tablets and statues, and the weapons used by the ancestors of the clan, as well as the sacred sacrificial cauldrons that suppress the fate of the major provinces,” Ye Qingyu exclaimed in disbelief.
How was that possible?
Ye Qingyu looked like he saw a ghost in the daytime.
Why was the ancestral temple that Yu Xiaoxing described completely different to what he saw?
Did he go the wrong way?
Impossible.
There was no side path in the Ancestral Temple; it was absolutely impossible to go the wrong way.
But why?
Ye Qingyu felt that everything he heard and saw today was too unbelievable.
After a brief pause, he came up with a plan. “Xing’er, can you accompany me into the ancestral temple? I have some questions... I may need you to go in with me to figure it out.”
Yu Xiaoxing’s beautiful, pale face reddened, as though thinking of other things. She hurriedly nodded and skipped over this, “Of course.”
The two people walked shoulder to shoulder into the Ancestral temple.
As Ye Qingyu entered the temple once more, his heart was uncontrollably pounding again
If Yu Xiaoxing saw that there was only a broken bluestone table remaining in the Ancestral temple, she would definitely jump up in shock?
Ye Qingyu thought to himself.
But very soon there was a blank expression on his face again.
“Why... is it like this?”
He couldn’t move.
Because everything before him was clearly different from before. There were statue-like armours lined up on both sides of the temple, and each armour hands were wielding weapons, treasure level antiques that were not lower in rank than the [White Horse Armour] of Youyan Pass' White Horse Tower.
In addition to the formation of human-shaped armours that were like bodyguards, the floor was paved with a scarlet red rug and complemented with gold threads and waves of energy. It was similar to walking on clouds.
As he went further in, there were several yellow sacred cauldrons of varying sizes that could suppress the fate of the major provinces, but they were at least three feet tall and had a gold-plated coiled dragon design. Each and every one was simple yet elegant, elaborate yet grand, splendid and magnificent.
There was a strange and mysterious energy flowing out from the sacred cauldron.
Further in, it was the inner hall.
There were statues of the ancestors of the Yu clan. Each one moulded from yellow clay, with bright and vivid colours, the size of a real person. There were incense burning and smoke rising in spirals...
Then further in...
Ye Qingyu was absolutely unable to believe in what he just saw.
What is going on here?
The scene that he saw he first time entered the temple and the scene at this moment was completely different... What went wrong?
Ye Qingyu sunk into a strange silent and lifeless state.
“Cousin, cousin... are you okay?”
Yu Xiaoxing yelled.
She, who was exceptionally smart, obviously noticed that Ye Qingyu had spaced out and was looking a little worried.
“Ah? Oh... “ Ye Qingyu shook his head, and forced a smile, “Nothing, I’m fine.”
What went wrong?
Why was it like that?
Ye Qingyu thought hard.
Suddenly a light flashed through his mind.
Yes, yes!
The first time he entered the Ancestral temple, he was following the lamp-like military medal. While this time the medal had fallen into a silent state and was no longer floating and glowing, but it was Yu Xiaoxing who guided him in.
This was the difference between his two times of entering Ancestral temple.
Ye Qingyu suddenly remembered that when the medal was guiding him into the Ancestral temple, there were vague patterns and light flickering on the walls. Could it be that...
Could it be... that reason?
Could it be that the Imperial Ancestral Temple contained two different spaces?
What kind of secret was hidden in the two different spaces?
But the Ancestral temple that his father mentioned in his last words, the place where he could find the truth, which space was it in?
Ye Qingyu began carefullly inspecting and sensing this sacrifical divine altar. But it was a pity that his spirit was crippled, so his power to sense was not strong.
After carefully observing for half an hour, he still made no discovery.
The military medal was now in a completely silent state, no longer emitting the slightest warmth, and was quietly located in the storage space, like a dead object.
It could no longer provide the slightest clue for Ye Qingyu.
Unwilling to give up, Ye Qingyu stayed in the Ancestral temple for another hour, until he was certain that he would not gain any new information in the Ancestral temple.
His intuition told him that, the truth was hiding in the other space of the Ancestral temple.
Under the strange gaze of Yu Xiaoxing, Ye Qingyu and her left the Ancestral temple.
The two beautiful cranes outside the temple came to greet him as soon as he came out, briskly jumping over, and affectionately rubbing their head against him.
Ye Qingyu smiled and stroked the two spiritual birds, and suddenly felt a little better inside.
Standing outside the Ancestral temple for another hour, Ye Qingyu decided to enter by himself once more to see if he could return to that empty broken bluestone table space.
Yu Xiaoxing found Ye Qingyu’s decision extremely strange.
But she didn’t stop him.
Logically speaking, the blood of the Imperial family, the Yu clan, did flow within Ye Qingyu’s body, but he was an indirect descent. He was not of pure royal blood. If he entered the Ancestral temple so frequently, not only would it seem strange and disrespectful but it also would break the rules.
But Yu Xiaxoing had placed all her heart on him. She had no intention of stopping him.
On that day, when she confronted Song Xiaojun, her feelings had uncontrollably surged forth like a flood.
And she didn’t want to hide it.
Watching Ye Qingyu enter the Ancestral temple for the third time, Yu Xiaoxiang did not ponder over what he was doing, and instead began playing with the two cranes.
She had been busy these several days, it was only at this time that she could show her true self, which was an innocent young girl.
About half an hour later.
Ye Qingyu came out looking upset.
“Let’s go," Ye Qingyu said in a disappointed tone.
At his third entry, the medal was still in a dormant state. It seemed that the intense heat last time had consumed all its energy.
Ye Qingyu was certain that he would have to return without any success this time.
He jumped onto the back of the crane and left the main peak in the midst of the crane’s cry.
Ye Qingyu turned his head round to take another glance at the sacred sword-like peak, and said to himself that, no matter what happens he would return, and the next time he does he must solve all the mysteries.
On the way back Ye Qingyu thought over and over again, and finally understood the reason why he came back with no harvest this time.
