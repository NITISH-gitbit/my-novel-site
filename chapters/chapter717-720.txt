Chapter 717:


Chapter 735 Walking on the Void


"This is the second move, and your second to the last chance."

Jiang Xiaohan's figure started to turn invisible and she no longer hid her true self. Only her head remained in solid form, while the rest of her body turned completely invisible and became one with the Black Demon qi that filled the air. She seemed to have become one with the heavens and was now so powerful that one could be driven to despair.

This sparked Ye Qingyu's fighting spirit, and one of his eyes flashed with lightning while the other turned cold and hard. He operated his [Supreme Ice Flame] and [Chaotic Thunder Liquid] frantically. While he did not know how Jiang Xiaohan had become so powerful, he could not help but feel excited at the thought of facing such a powerful opponent.

"[Ice River Rages Forth]... kill!"

He raised his hand and a true dragon formed by ice appeared from his palm, instantly transforming into a gigantic icy river that sealed the area for thousands of meters around. The extreme frost pervaded the air and seemed to have even caused the surrounding Black Demon qi to freeze.

The icy river resembled an ancient mountain range on the verge of collapse and released a powerful roar that shook the heavens as it swept powerfully at Jiang Xiaohan.

"This is merely a pretty spectacle without any true power... the control you wield over your strength is way too pathetic," Jiang Xiaohan scoffed as she saw the gigantic icy river and raised her hand again.

She still deployed her [Black Demon Palm of All Things].

Boom!

The icy river shook and then shattered.

Almost at the same time, Ye Qingyu's figure moved so quickly it was as if he had the ability to teleport, defying all odds to stand at the top of this icy river.

The icy river changed the direction of its attack. Ye Qingyu's black hair fluttered in the wind, his eyes sharp to the point of being mysterious and ever-changing. At that moment, he looked like a divine king who was descending from the sky on a divine carriage and almost immediately reached beside his opponent.

"Hmm? This is..." Jiang Xiaohan's countenance changed.

Ye Qingyu had attacked from close range in two different ways, but their one similarity was that they managed to easily break past her protective force field. Such a technique was indeed mysterious.

"Freeze the heavens," Ye Qingyu uttered an ancient language and operated the law of mystery.

The temperature of the already chilly world suddenly dropped even further and an immense chill gathered beside Jiang Xiaohan. She had yet to react before the chill completely enveloped her and a large icy mountain crushed her and kept her frozen within.

The [Fiendgod Titled Chart] of the ancient bronze book had recorded countless fiendgod techniques. This technique to control ice was said to be the combat technique of an ancient witch whose veins flowed with icy blood. Ye Qingyu had once researched this technique and found that it was most compatible with his [Supreme Ice Flame]. Now that he finally unleashed it today, it truly lived up to his expectations.

Jiang Xiaohan was trapped within the icy mountain as if she was imprisoned in an icy coffin. She could only feel the terrifying chill everywhere, it was like being burnt by fiery flames, only aiming to freeze her to ashes.

"[Black Demon Palm of All Things]... destroy!" she shouted.

She used a mysterious technique to fan the Black Demon power in her, causing Â a strange power to start spreading outward from her body. A cracking sound could be heard from the ice mountain as visible cracks formed on the ice mountain that radiated outward.

"So soon?" Ye Qingyu was shocked.

The [Supreme Ice Flame] had the power to burn everything and its technique was based on the operation of his icy blood. Even an expert at peak Immortal Step realm would find it difficult to break past its shackles so quickly. He had not expected this technique to be able to kill Jiang Xiaohan, but her ability to break past its seal far exceeded his expectations.

This thought only flashed past his mind for a moment, but his hands never hesitated as he smashed a palm forth toward the icy mountain. His frozen killing god's icy power rolled forth endlessly as icy true dragons roared thunderously one by one. These dragons circled the icy mountain and ice frothed from their mouths as they spurted ice crystals and quickly fortified the seal on the icy mountain.

Those cracked that had appeared immediately disappeared.

Anger could be seen on Jiang Xiaohan's face as she continued to struggle to break past the ice.

Ye Qingyu heaved a sigh of relief in secret.

He knew that this ice mountain would never be able to hold this woman for eternity, so he operated a 108-word ancient technique. He planned to operate the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to seal her within the cauldron.

At that moment, he sensed an extremely dangerous aura coming from behind him.

It felt like the god of death had reached out and was almost about to grip his neck .

His figure flashed as he immediately used his [Ghostly Shadow] technique to transform himself into a shadow and disappeared from view.

"Ha ha ha.... you got lucky there," Jiang Xiaohan's laughter was full of scorn and derision as it echoed through the void.

Blood suddenly spurted forth from both of Ye Qingyu's shoulders.

Ye Qingyu's face hardened. He opened his mouth and all the blood that flowed out of him transformed into a blood pill that he sucked back into his body.

Silverly flames circled the wound on his back and exterminated the Black Demon qi within his wound. His wound then healed instantaneously.

He looked up and his face turned pale with anger and shock when he saw that Jiang Xiaohan's body was still trapped within the ice mountain.

Ye Qingyu had now already figured out that what was trapped within it was just a phantom avatar.

The true Jiang Xiaohan was floating one hundred meters away, looking at him with derision and scorn.

She had already escaped at the moment cracks appeared on the ice mountain earlier.

Now that she was one with the Black Demon qi, even the tiniest flowing light would be a chance for her to escape, let alone something like a crack on a mountain. The figure entrapped within the ice mountain was just a phantom avatar formed from Black Demon qi.

"Ha ha ha, Brother Qingyu, you're just too dumb. As I've mentioned, I'll be invincible as long as the area has a trace of Black Demon qi. You must be out of your mind to even think of trapping me," her voice reverberated across the Black Demon qi, which formed a strange echo.

Ye Qingyu frowned and protected his ears with the surrounding purple lightning because Jiang Xiaohan's demonic voice affected one's heart and soul.

An average martial arts expert would have already lost control of his vitality and died from his body exploding.

Jiang Xiaohan has already gotten so powerful...what exactly has she gone through?
Ye Qingyu thought to himself in shock.

What exactly had she encountered after the Battle of Light City to have turned her into who she was today? Even a peerless genius could not have improved by so much in such a short period of time.

This was a pity.

If Jiang Xiaohan was willing to help the envoy mission of Heaven Wasteland Domain, it would increase their rate of success in the upcoming appraisal process.

However...

Ye Qingyu shook his head. He knew that this was just wishful thinking.

Jiang Xiaohan did not even ask after her birth parents, so the chances of her lending a helping hand to the envoy mission was close to none.

"How does it feel to be injured?" Jiang Xiaohan asked as she drew close to Ye Qingyu.

Black Demon qi raged across the skies and brought along a terrifying limitation to his vision as it pressed toward him like an ocean being emptied.

"You'll know soon enough," Ye Qingyu raised his hand again.

His figure flashed and disappeared from where he was.

A scornful smile danced across Jiang Xiaohan's lips and she used her divine consciousness to control the Black Demon qi that radiated everywhere like water rippling across a river.

The [Fallen God Abyss] was where Black Demon qi was in abundant supply, so Jiang Xiaohan, who had already grasped the magical ability of the Black Demon Race, could never be defeated here. No magical ability nor mystery could escape her.

This was why she lured Ye Qingyu to the [Fallen God Abyss] and also the reason why she chose this place for their battle.

However...

An expression of surprise slowly spread across her features for she could not grasp any trace of Ye Qingyu at all.

It was as though he had completely disappeared within the [Fallen God Abyss].

"How could this be?" Jiang Xiaohan found this completely unbelievable.

At that moment...

Rip!

She heard a noise that sounded like paper being torn up.

The space where she was at suddenly ripped apart without warning along with everything within this part of the void. Jiang Xiaohan was completely caught off guard and she felt like she was just like a character drawn within a painting that was torn apart. The moment the void ripped apart, her body was also torn into pieces.

"Uh... puff!"

She opened her mouth and a black blood arrow shot out from it.

"This is what getting injured feels like...the Law of Lightning and Thunder - Imprisonment!" Ye Qingyu said as he reappeared.

Lightning surrounded his body and the thunderous roll of thunder could be heard emanating from his body. He resembled a god of thunder that had absolute control over thunder and lightning, his divine authority palpable as he strode forth from the shredded void. He raised his hand and an ancient formation imprinted with purple lightning appeared in his hand. That ancient formation shot toward Jiang Xiaohan's head and unleashed a power of imprisonment to transform into a prison formed from lightning that trapped her within.

"You..." Jiang Xiaohan was shocked and enraged.

Ye Qingyu did not give her the chance. The lightning and thunder that encircled him turned into countless purple streams of light which then transformed into divine swords formed from lightning and thunder that shot incessantly toward Jiang Xiaohan.

Boom!

The powerful lightning destroyed the heavens.

The ancient formation of imprisonment was destroyed along with Jiang Xiaohan's shredded figure.

Ye Qingyu still did not dare to let down his guard, for he clearly sensed at the moment that Jiang Xiaohan did not perish.

Rather, she made use of an instant of flowing light to escape.

Just as he expected, his body soon tingled with a feeling of impending danger.

Jiang Xiaohan's face had darkened and a trace of blood could be seen on the fair corners of her lips. She gripped a Black Demon sword that was formed by Black Demon qi tightly within her elegant fingers. She was as dangerous as a poisonous snake as she slashed out ruthlessly at him.

The Black Demon sword affected the surrounding Black Demon qi, which reacted like an ocean bursting from its dam.

The surrounding space was almost completely destroyed, causing the rays of light to become distorted and unrealistic.

Ye Qingyu summoned a large longsword from his [Cloud Top Cauldron] and blocked the move with his backhand.

Boom!

He was thrown backward.

The large longsword in his hand was immediately destroyed and exploded into pieces.

Ye Qingyu's vital organs shook violently and he tasted the sweet taste of blood in his throat. A blood arrow spurted from his mouth, while an empty handle was all that was left in his hands.

This longsword was of the highest quality from the [Refine Armor] while he was at Sunrise City. It commanded a high price and was known as the [Slash of Heaven]. Ye Qingyu had selected a few of those for his personal use, but it had been destroyed by Jiang Xiaohan in an instant as easily as rotten wood.

"Hahaha, Brother Qingyu, you can't keep going on like this. The gap in our strength is far too wide. Bring on your most powerful defense to take this blow from me."

Jiang Xiaohan moved like a tarsal bone maggot and quickly drew near to him.

The Black Demon sword's power increased yet again.

Ye Qingyu's eyes glittered like divine flames.

He could now see that Jiang Xiaohan's sword power drew upon the power of Heaven and earth, and called upon all the Black Demon qi in this [Fallen God Abyss]. It was much too powerful and was not something he would be able to block.

"[Walking on the Void]!" he growled.

Swish!

His figure flashed as he disappeared from view yet again.

Boom!

Jiang Xiaohan's sword smashed against the ground and caused the entire [Fallen God Abyss] to shudder as the earth shook with intensity.

"He disappeared again..." Jiang Xiaohan was even more astonished.

Ye Qingyu had once again disappeared without a trace, exactly like the previous time, in the same mysterious manner. Logically, nothing within this [Fallen God Abyss] could escape her control, not even the most mysterious or secretive technique. She should be able to pick out a flaw in the technique, but why was it that each time Ye Qingyu disappeared, he managed to do it so seamlessly?

What kind of technique was that?

Chapter 718:


Chapter 736 The Annihilating Eye
The next moment, the sound of the void being torn rang out once more.
Like a painting being torn, the void barrier at where Jiang Xiaohan was burst open together with her body. She once again felt the excruciating pain of her body being ripped apart.
Having bathed in lightning, Ye Qingyu once again stepped out from a fissure in the void.
A horrific shredding force circulated within the terrifying pitch-black fissure and seemed as if it wanted to devour everything. Yet, Ye Qingyu remained totally undisturbed and walked within the void like a demon god.
The terrible lightning strikes caught Jiang Xiaohan off-guard and submerged her once more.
Black Demon qi billowed.
Jiang Xiaohan's body was shattered and dissipated, drifting into an insubstantial plume of smoke.
The next moment, however, she formed a new body as the Black Demon qi in the distance surged.
"What kind of technique are you using?" Jiang Xiaohan was shocked and exasperated. The demonic sound rang out again as the Black Demon qi trembled together with the universe. Countless streaks of Black Demon sword light swept toward Ye Qingyu like a torrential storm, trying to rip him apart.
"
The [Secret Void Manual]
." Ye Qingyu's stentorian voice caused the surrounding Black Demon qi to flip and recede like rolling waves.
He grabbed in the air at random.
His five fingers turned completely into a body of purple light, which contained an inexplicable Dao essence, and tore down a patch of the void barrier. It shielded his body. Purplish ancient hierograms gleamed scintillatingly. The void barrier had turned into a huge shield, blocking before his body.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Ear-deafening booms rang out.
All the sword lights of the demon qi were directly blocked by the void barrier shield, rippling wave-like and glittering on the surface of the shield.
Ye Qingyu did not hide anything.
His combat skill was called the [
Secret Void Manual
]. Like the earlier
Ice Bloodline
secret, it was from a section on the titled demon gods in the Bronze book [
The Fiendgod Titled Chart
].
The [
Secret Void Manual
] was from an erstwhile age of demon gods. It was a manual of talents and magical abilities from a divine race which was adept at manipulating the void. It was said that, once mastered, one would be able to shuttle through voids at will and tear through them to kill - the foremost occult technique among the divine assassination techniques.
In recent years, Ye Qingyu's yuan qi cultivation had been increasing constantly. After unlocking the vast amount of information in the [
Fiendgod Titled Chart
], he could read and comprehend its many techniques. Beyond those he had taught Bai Yuanxing, Jin Ling'er, Lang Yong, Li Rui, and the rest, he had also learned many other occult techniques which he had never displayed. It did not mean that he had not practiced or mastered them.
So far, even Ye Qingyu had lost count of how many occult techniques he had mastered from the Bronze book [
The Fiendgod Titled Chart
]
...
it must have been plenty.
Given Ye Qingyu's comprehension power and the mysterious power of the nameless breathing technique, no technique would prove too difficult for him to employ.
The
[Secret Void Manual
] was one of these occult techniques.
In his fights with opponents, Ye Qingyu would usually refrain from using the techniques in the [
Fiendgod Titled Chart
], as he was determined to strike out his own path on the martial road and thus had to avoid developing a dependence on the
chart.
But in a place like the [Fallen God Abyss], Jiang Xiaohan, who had mastered the Black Demons' magical abilities, would be like a fish in water. She could borrow the power of the heavens and the earth and become near-invincible, and thus Ye Qingyu could not confront her directly. The most suitable way was obviously to employ the void walking and attrition techniques of the [
Secret Void Manual
].
His decision was not wrong.
His two walks on the void had injured Jiang Xiaohan badly.
"
The Secret Void Manual
? I've never heard of it. Which sect does this skill belong to?" A piercingly cold murderous intent gleamed in Jiang Xiaohan's eyes as she displayed a combat pose.
Everywhere across the sky, the Black Demon qi was contorting. It turned into two several-kilometer-long gigantic Black Demon Dragons, covered with black spikes, with fiery black flames in their eyes. They were like ferocious beasts from hell, enveloped with black demon fire on their entire bodies, roaring angrily as they soared toward Ye Qingyu, winding around to kill him.
"Scram!"
Ye Qingyu bellowed, a dragon roar emerging from his open mouth.
Two streaks of Supreme Ice Flame spouted out from his mouth. In a flash, they had expanded, growing rapidly in size and ending up as two giant Divine Ice Dragons, roaring and gliding up to meet the Black Demon Dragon.
Roar! Roar!
The dragons howled repeatedly, shaking the heavens and the earth.
Four giant, magic dragons clashed and coiled madly about, their huge bodies striking one another. Their chill and demon qi rubbed against one another as they tried to kill. The scene was as terrible to behold as in a mythical war: huge ice boulders flying and splintering, black demon qi constantly exploding...
Finally, the giant Ice Dragons turned into ice flakes all over the sky.
The Black Demon Dragon was dying. It held out with its last breath and finally turned into a black mist, dissipating.
"Haha, so your strength can be exhausted! But within the Fallen God Abyss, my power is inexhaustible. Brother Qingyu, how much longer can you last?"
Jiang Xiaohan's smile blossomed like a flower.
But on that absolutely pretty face and smile, there was a chilling killing intent that bit into the bones.
"Just try it. Then you'll know."
Ye Qingyu looked calm and a fiery flame blazed in his eyes. In them were an yin and a yang: the absolute yin of the Ice Flame, the absolute yang of the Lightning, from which engendered countless profound mysteries.
"The Annihilating Eye."
Two streaks of light, one silver and one purple, burst out from Ye Qingyu's eyes. They were like two light pillars or cannons which could annihilate every substance in the world, hurtling toward Jiang Xiaohan in an instant.
Jiang Xiaohan stirred up the Black Demon qi and turned it into a huge shield, trying to block out the rays from those lights. Yet, within an instant, the silver and purple lights had bore two holes through the shield and through her body...
"Ah... and what power is that?" She was stunned, feeling her body breaking down and disintegrating. It was almost impossible to reassemble it again.
Ye Qingyu stood erect on the void, his eyes opened wide and gleaming with a divine radiance. Everywhere he stared, the light annihilated everything and was absolutely unstoppable.
"The incarnation of the Black Demon!"
Jiang Xiaohan's long hair started to drift in the air, her half-annihilated form desperately flashing: one flash and it divided into two, two flashes and they divided into four... It kept on splitting into newer, magical doppelgangers. Within the blink of an eye, she had turned into ten thousand doppelgangers, every one a spitting image of another, impossible to tell apart.
The divine radiance from Ye Qingyu's eyes kept on sweeping, disintegrating these numerous Jiang Xiaohans into smoke and dust.
After ten breaths, the divine light from his eyes began to dim.
As Ye Qingyu's eyes blinked, the eyeballs in his sockets seemed invisible. They had been subsumed into the purple and silver lights and his eyes seemed like two bottomless pits--wormholes into the mysterious realms of the boundless universe, thoroughly bizarre and terrifying.
The flame was like a fluid circulating within his eyes.
"Ha ha ha, I'm right in expecting Brother Qingyu not to last." Jiang Xiaohan's voice rang out again. The surrounding Black Demon qi billowed, engulfing the heavens and the earth. It seemed not to have dwindled.
Ye Qingyu's expression was solemn.
In this environment, Jiang Xiaohan was really in an invincible position. No matter what kind of combat skill or technique a person used, it would be almost impossible to kill her.
This was the reason why, despite the Black Demon Emperor having disappeared for so many years and despite no more martial emperor emerging from the Black Demon race, they could stand firm in the Alliance of Domains. In a place like the Black Demon Pool, any expert who could master the black demon occult techniques to the extreme would be almost invincible--unless a martial emperor could first destroy the Black Demon Pool.
"Brother Qingyu, you are very strong indeed. If you don't die, I'm sure you have a slim chance to become an emperor. Unfortunately... " Jiang Xiaohan tittered lightly and regret could be seen in her eyes. She looked to have the situation under control. Standing above all, she swept her gaze down below her. "Unfortunately, I cannot allow you to live. Otherwise, you will be a hindrance to my path as an Empress!"
She stared at Ye Qingyu without the former mocking expression on her face.
Her pretty, elfish eyes began to turn progressively icy. Jiang Xiaohan's thoughts turned and numerous black demon qi congregated, protecting her heavily within. The Black Demon sword in her hands started to draw on the Black Demon power all across the sky.
Boom!
Ye Qingyu's facial color changed and he kept on retreating.
Although it was the same stroke, he still felt that he could not counter it.
"Walking on the void!"
Ye Qingyu's figure trembled a little and he disappeared from where he was a third time.
Jiang Xiaohan's Black Demon sword struck the air and cleaved into the Fallen God Abyss, forming a gigantic fissure on the ground directly.
Smoke and dust filled the air.
Gravel flew all around.
Ye Qingyu's figure and aura remained untraceable.
"Ha ha, I'd like to see how far you can hide... " Jiang Xiaohan sneered and her sword turned suddenly. She slashed into the Black Demon Grass herbal field, looking as if she would destroy this entire patch of grass.
Rip!
The sound of cloth tearing resounded.
A void had torn, also rending the giant Black Demon Sword. The huge vortex gravity from the ripped space-time fissure, derived from the power of the Law and great Dao, had devoured the remaining Black Demon sword and its terrifying sword aura.
Ye Qingyu stood before the Black Demon Grass field, his figure tottering. He opened his mouth to spew out a series of blood arrows.
Although his Secret Void Manual had managed to counter Jiang Xiaohan's strike, this headlong collision had caused him to be injured again. His bones had fractured and his muscles had torn; he had sustained grave injuries.
"So pitiful... " Jiang Xiaohan snickered, her eyes full of pity, as if they were looking at a pheasant fallen into the water. "Let's call it a day."
Her elegant, small, jade-like hand waved gently. Her five fingers closed into a grip and the streams of demon qi turned into a gigantic magic Demon Sword, its aura stronger and its power even more frightful than before.
From her point of view, the outcome was clear. Ye Qingyu was at his wit's end.
However...
Ye Qingyu was seriously injured but the corners of his lips suddenly arched upward.
His originally distinct figure blurred gradually like an illusive green mist, becoming very unreal, like a faded watercolor painting.
Then, the coldness of an autumn brook spread in from her lower abdomen.
A hand blade emerged from Jiang Xiaohan's abdomen without any warning.
Five fingers like knives.
A silver flame blazed on it.
The flames blazed on, revealing Jiang Xiaohan's shocked countenance. She bowed her head with difficulty, an expression of incredulity on her face. She wanted to turned her head back but at this moment, heard an icy snicker resounding in the heavens and the earth. It chuckled as if it was mocking life itself...
Watching the countless, pale, silvery figures flashing frantically and encircling to kill... these figures were like a mist, like flowing light, like a mad gale, like flowing smoke, like the appearance of a fiery planet, like a drifting fog surging on...
The flickering light and shadow darted in from every direction, arriving to kill, amidst all those icy snickers!
The Shadow Flowing Kill!
A strike to kill!
Jiang Xiaohan was not the only one who could reproduce identical figures outside her body. She was not the only one who could pass off the unreal for the real. Ye Qingyu could do the same too.
Chapter 736 The Annihilating Eye

"Ha ha, I'd like to see how far you can hide... " Jiang Xiaohan sneered and her sword turned suddenly. She slashed into the Black Demon Grass herbal field, looking as if she would destroy this entire patch of grass.

Rip!

The sound of cloth tearing resounded.

A void had torn, also rending the giant Black Demon Sword. The huge vortex gravity from the ripped space-time fissure, derived from the power of the Law and great Dao, had devoured the remaining Black Demon sword and its terrifying sword aura.

Ye Qingyu stood before the Black Demon Grass field, his figure tottering. He opened his mouth to spew out a series of blood arrows.

Although his Secret Void Manual had managed to counter Jiang Xiaohan's strike, this headlong collision had caused him to be injured again. His bones had fractured and his muscles had torn; he had sustained grave injuries.

"So pitiful... " Jiang Xiaohan snickered, her eyes full of pity, as if they were looking at a pheasant fallen into the water. "Let's call it a day."

Her elegant, small, jade-like hand waved gently. Her five fingers closed into a grip and the streams of demon qi turned into a gigantic magic Demon Sword, its aura stronger and its power even more frightful than before.

From her point of view, the outcome was clear. Ye Qingyu was at his wit's end.

However...

Ye Qingyu was seriously injured but the corners of his lips suddenly arched upward.

His originally distinct figure blurred gradually like an illusive green mist, becoming very unreal, like a faded watercolor painting.

Then, the coldness of an autumn brook spread in from her lower abdomen.

A hand blade emerged from Jiang Xiaohan's abdomen without any warning.

Five fingers like knives.

A silver flame blazed on it.

The flames blazed on, revealing Jiang Xiaohan's shocked countenance. She bowed her head with difficulty, an expression of incredulity on her face. She wanted to turned her head back but at this moment, heard an icy snicker resounding in the heavens and the earth. It chuckled as if it was mocking life itself...

Watching the countless, pale, silvery figures flashing frantically and encircling to kill... these figures were like a mist, like flowing light, like a mad gale, like flowing smoke, like the appearance of a fiery planet, like a drifting fog surging on...

The flickering light and shadow darted in from every direction, arriving to kill, amidst all those icy snickers!

The Shadow Flowing Kill!

A strike to kill!

Jiang Xiaohan was not the only one who could reproduce identical figures outside her body. She was not the only one who could pass off the unreal for the real. Ye Qingyu could do the same too.

Chapter 719:


Chapter 737 - A Murderous Spirit Breaking Out
It was only an unreal shadow which had suffered grave injuries and vomited blood.
He only executed his true killing strike at this moment.
After the blazing [Supreme Ice Flame] had been injected into Jiang Xiaohan's body, its power was enough to incinerate everything. Even though she had mastered the Black Demon qi, she could feel the crisis of approaching death.
"Change... break up the body, the [Black Demon Split]!" she yelled, urging the Black Demon body to the extreme. Her shapely, curvaceous body was engulfed in the surging, scorching Black Demon qi as it kept splitting into demon doppelgangers.
Finally, the [Supreme Ice Flame] incinerated her original form into ice cinders, as if removing an ulcer close to her bones. She was reborn into a completely new body.
"You... deserve death!" Jiang Xiaohan's voice was ice-cold, without a trace of human feeling, causing one to shiver.
Although the [Black Demon Split] could pass the unreal for the real, allowing her to substitute a false body for the real one, doing so gravely depleted her foundation. For her, this was a real and heavy injury which almost killed her.
She had expected this battle to be an easy win. She had made Huang Tayun set the traps one by one and draw Ye Qingyu into an impossible situation, because she wanted to shame him completely. She wanted to strip Ye Qingyu of his former arrogance and destroy her previous self-inferiority, to remove the last black mark in her martial heart and bid farewell to the former her forever.
She did not expect...
... herself to be nearly killed.
It was really... unforgivable.
On the opposite side.
Ye Qingyu's heart suffered a shock as well.
In the past, the [Supreme Ice Flame] technique had always been invincible. As long as it could get injected into an opponent's body, even a superior at the peak of the Immortal Step realm would be decimated in body and spirit. Yet, despite all his desperate attempts, his [Shadow Flowing Kill] could break through Jiang Xiaohan's defense but could not kill her...
By now, his injuries were already quite serious.
Ye Qingyu wanted to use the unfinished [Blood Drinker Sword] but there was no blood here, neither was this a mass fight. Besides, Jiang Xiaohan's Black Demon body vacillated between the unreal and the real, so the [Blood Drinker Sword] could not affect her either.
"Kill!"
Jiang Xiaohan struck out angrily again.
Ye Qingyu was not frightened at all and fought back ferociously.
Their bitter, terrifying, frantic combat continued.
In an instant, a day and a night had passed.
The two superiors could not kill each other; each had so many ways to preserve their own lives. However, they too suffered grave injuries. Blood was everywhere in the [Fallen God Abyss].
A superior in such a realm had mighty reserves of power in their blood essence. One drop could revive a corpse or kill tens of thousands. Every lost drop meant a corresponding depreciation of cultivation and lifespan.
Within a radius of a few thousand kilometers beyond the battlefield, the land had all been leveled: the granite rocks were pulverized and mountains had become deep craters. The ground was dyed red with blood and the stench of blood was everywhere.
"Ah... " Jiang Xiaohan cried loudly as she severed Ye Qingyu's arm.
And Ye Qingyu's Ice Flame Sword pierced through her slim waist at the same time.
The battle had reached a point of extreme brutality. Their every stroke sought to kill their opponent without regard for their own life.
Their strengths had reached a certain level. Almost instantaneously, their severed limbs had grown back; the wounds were healed. Yet, the speed with which they healed themselves became slower and slower. Their faces became more and more pallid. Their bodies were pierced with countless stabs. Their footsteps faltered; each strand of their hair was stained with their opponent's blood, as if they had been in a bloodbath.
In an instant, another day and night had passed.
The battle continued.
Crimson blood soaked the earth.
The blood of a superior existence seemed unquenchable, like a flowing fountain, forming blood pools and rivulets on the ground. The flowing blood was absorbed into the earth under the [Fallen God Abyss].
A mysterious, invisible force was surging in the depths of the earth.
The taste of streaming blood seemed to have awakened a horrific presence underground. The earth trembled slightly; some terrible force was awakening.
Almost instantaneously, both Ye Qingyu and Jiang Xiaohan had sensed an uncomfortable, quaking force.
Their faces changed color.
Yet the battle continued unabated.
Both Ye Qingyu and Jiang Xiaohan were fighting with a true, inner fire. They kept engaging each other, unable to stop; stopping would mean defeat, which in turn meant imminent death.
Another day passed in an instant.
By now, even Ye Qingyu had to admire Jiang Xiaohan.
He himself had undergone so many difficult battles; he had a wealth of combat experiences and a brutal fortitude. Yet Jiang Xiaohan had been able to last as long and fight with such ferocity and fervor. This was beyond Ye Qingyu's expectation. He could look down on this woman no longer.
One had to admit that Ye Qingyu saw in Jiang Xiaohan the shadow of a supreme fighter. This woman was terrifying: she had an indomitable will and was determined to give up everything to attain her goal. This alone would make her a fitting sovereign.
Yet this fact also surprised Ye Qingyu.
The last time he saw Jiang Xiaohan, she was trembling at the feet of Ao Tianzun--a small girl succumbing to his every will and whim. Yet now, she could muster such strong battle will and grit...
This was terrifying.
The din of killing was deafening.
Their fight was like a battle between thousands of troops and horses. The evil blood qi had permeated into the sky. Blood was streaming like a river on the ground, flooding the earth and flowing into the distance. Several thousand kilometers away, even the Blood Demon Grass herbal field had been inundated. The blood sank deep into the bowels of the earth.
A disturbing, terrifying aura had become more and more distinct. The battling Ye Qingyu and Jiang Xiaohan felt a horrific pressure; their muscles and bones were chilled, as if a stabbing cold had penetrated their bodies. A murderous spirit crept out from the crevices of the earth and permeated the place, as if trying to shred them into pieces.
"What power is that?" Jiang Xiaohan was shocked, sensing the approaching danger.
Ye Qingyu's own unease grew stronger as well.
The Chief of the Black Armor Race had said that a superior at the Great Saint level had perished here. This must be true. Otherwise, there would not be so many magical, divine herbs at the bottom of this abyss. They had grown to their full proportions but no one had harvested them.
There had been no abnormalities in the [Fallen God Abyss] in the past. It made Ye Qingyu neglect this terror. Now, his heart once again missed a beat.
He distinctly felt that, had that terrible presence under the [Fallen God Abyss] awakened and spread upward, he would be instantaneously slain.
Was it the power which had strangled and killed the Martial Saint?
We cannot continue here, or the consequences would be unimaginable.
Ye Qingyu grew anxious.
Jiang Xiaohan was even more anxious than him.
She had mastered the Black Demon qi and could sense even more strongly the terror in that deep, underground power.
Their mad fighting continued.
Gradually, Ye Qingyu began to gain the upper hand.
He mobilized the Wuji Divine Force and his strength increased exponentially. The silver Sky Dragon armor that clad his entire body flashed indistinctly. The brutal physical force began to show its power as their inner yuan started to deplete. Jiang Xiaohan had injured her foundation, but she executed the mysterious Black Demon Race technique. She was not able to execute it with the ease she had at the start...
Boom!
Ye Qingyu delivered a punch. His fist was bloody and his finger bones were ashen white.
Jiang Xiaohan was thrown back directly.
"No... !" she growled loudly, fighting back madly.
Ye Qingyu edged forward and pounded his fists away like they were hammers the size of mountains, dashing everything into bits.
Jiang Xiaohan was thrown backward again.
She could not take her defeat lying down.
At this moment, a sudden transformation occured--
Boom!
A wisp of mighty, vast and terrifying qi curses broke out from the crevices of the earth, streaming out like from a distant spring and shooting into the void like a sharp sword.
"Puff!"
The place where Ye Qingyu was standing was the very spot where the wisp of qi activity had burst out from. He could not dodge it. The wisp chopped at him, severing his arm.
Blood splashed through the air.
Jiang Xiaohan saw this and was elated. She took the opportunity to attack frantically.
Ye Qingyu's situation was now precarious.
The wisp of qi had emitted from under the earth. It was most horrific and contained infinite grievances. Even with his cultivation, Ye Qingyu could not make his severed limb grow back. He felt even more strongly the power of that cursing grievance madly eating into his blood, flesh and strength at the site of the wound.
Boom!
Ye Qingyu was thrown back.
Jiang Xiaohan's disheveled hair was stained with blood, like that of a female demon. Her Black Demon sword had successfully slashed Ye Qingyu's body and thrown him back into the distant cliffs.
Swish!
Another terrible qi curse burst out from the bowels of the earth.
Jiang Xiaohan was almost hit as she stepped backward frantically.
Swish, swish, swish!
Streams of terrific curses burst out from the crevices of the earth and soared into the sky like a spring.
Everywhere it soared, the Black Demon qi melted and disintegrated.
Jiang Xiaohan kept on dodging.
"There's no way I can stay here, the apocalyptic murderous spirit has ascended into the world. Those horrible creatures underground will be formally revived... " She stared at Ye Qingyu, drenched in blood and struggling in the distance, and wanted to kill him. But the series of terrible curses emitting from the ground prevented her approach.
Ye Qingyu was imprisoned all around by the cursing qi as he ended up in the most hopeless of situations.
"Even Heaven is helping me in this battle. Admit defeat! I will not kill you, but I doubt you can live anyway... " Jiang Xiaohan sneered coldly; looking at Ye Qingyu, the emotions in her stare became somewhat complex. "I will erect a monument for you. You can rest assured and die."
Her voice subsided.
Her figure turned into a scintillating Black Demon qi as she soared into the sky. She wanted to leave the battlefield and the [Fallen God Abyss].
However at this moment, a fissure appeared in the void and materialized without warning above her. Its terrifying suction force began to suck Jiang Xiaohan into it, something she was totally unprepared for.
"Walking on the void!"
Ye Qingyu displayed his mysterious Void technique and burst out from his previously impossible position. A power drew Jiang Xiaohan into the Void fissure. Almost instantaneously, space changed and the heavens and the earth switched places. By the time Jiang Xiaohan had clambered out of the fissure, she was already in that perilous spot Ye Qingyu was originally in.
"Ah...!" Jiang Xiaohan shrieked hideously and piteously.
Her body had been penetrated in six places by as many streams of the terrible cursing qi. It disintegrated...
"The Black Demon [Blood Curse Split]... Ye Qingyu, I won't die. I'll come back for you. Between the two of us, only one can live!" She struggled madly as a black flame began to consume her from her heart. Her body instantaneously turned into thousands of wispy, spangled, Black Demon qi, permeating and dissipating into the Void.
At the same time--
Baboomboom!
The [Fallen God Abyss] began to shake violently. Layers and layers of earth cracked open and drifted into the sky. A viscous, bloody light streamed out from the crevices and dyed the world red. Even the ubiquitous Black Demon qi had been dissipated...
The terrible cursing qi had completely erupted and surged powerfully in every direction like the torrential tides, permeating the heavens and the earth.
"Oh no... there's no way to leave."
Ye Qingyu was astounded.
He quickly brought out the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and prepared a sacrifice, encasing himself in it to protect his body. This was the only way out he could think of. He hoped that the [Cloud Top Cauldron] could counter that mysterious, terrible, cursing qi and murderous spirit from the bowels of the earth.
The next moment, the copper cauldron shook violently.
That terrifying cursing qi had burst out in a series of explosions, submerging the [Cloud Top Cauldron] completely in its midst.

Chapter 720:


Chapter 738 Clan Extermination


When Ye Qingyu was in the [Cloud Top Cauldron], he felt as if he was trapped in a wine barrel that was bobbing up and down in a choppy sea - he was thrown around in the cauldron without warning and suffered bouts of dizziness as a result.

There seemed to be something that was crashing heavily on the exterior of the bronze cauldron, and the resounding echoes were deafening. Ye Qingyu was soon seeing stars, and the terrible conditions aggravated his injuries, leading him to spew blood from his mouth again...

He wanted to channel the mantra of one hundred and eight characters to activate the defensive mechanism of the [Cloud Top Cauldron], but he could not gather his senses about him amidst all the sound and movement.

Damn, I'm really going to die this time. I'll be shaking to death in this bronze cauldron...
Ye Qingyu thought, laughing bitterly.

He was already seriously wounded from the fight with Jiang Xiaohan, and coupled with the fact that one of his arms had been chopped off by the terrible cursed qi activity, he was at his most vulnerable state now. The incredibly violent vibrations caused him to almost faint, but luckily he still had a shred of willpower left that made Ye Qingyu hang on.

Ye Qingyu was in a state of semi-consciousness, and he did not know how long it was he had been inside the cauldron. He was now treading the thin line between life and death.

Gradually, the echoes and vibrations started to disappear.

The interior walls of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] gave off a bronze glow, as if forming a protective halo around Ye Qingyu. A faint but dense vapor of a mysterious yellow color appeared, continually entering and exiting his broken body. It was a weird sight to behold.

Within the space of its interior, at the same spot where Ye Qingyu collected the weird white rocks, pools of blood were flowing away before being subsequently absorbed by the rocks.

Ancient drawings of battle scenes hung on the inner walls of the cauldron. The forebears depicted in these drawings seemed to be alive as they constantly evolved into different scenes of conquest and hunting. Sounds of battle accompanied, the screams and roars extremely realistic. It was as if the drawings were holographic projections, and they kept constantly changing.

The columns of mysterious yellow vapor came from these drawings.

A profound aura that was hard to describe was encompassed in the vapor.

Ye Qingyu's body, which was originally broken, began to slowly regenerate as the vapor passed in and out of it. It looked as if the columns of vapor were threads that were stitching him up.

He was in a state of semi-unconsciousness and death. As such, he could not speak, breathe through his nose, or move his arms and eyes. Subconsciously, he could vaguely feel the changes in his body.

In his dantian world, the yuan qi, which had originally been suppressed by the Black Demon qi of the [Fallen God Abyss], was finally restored completely. The consolidated pool of yuan qi began to surge again, and Yuan Qi True Self-Doppelganger, which was as powerful as a level one hurricane, gave out an angry roar as it suddenly awoke.

At the same time, three rays of splendor, each green, silver, and purple in color respectively, began blinking. They flowed around unpredictably throughout his entire body, passing through his internal organs and spreading throughout his bones and muscles.

The green ray symbolized the power of wind.

It was the Dao foundation of wind given to him by the mysterious figure in the lake below Sunrise City.

The silver ray symbolized heat.

It was the power of the [Supreme Ice Flame].

Finally, the purple ray symbolized light.

It was the power of Chaotic Thunder Liquid left behind by the Lightning Emperor.

These three forms of power could all be considered as among the most rare types that existed in this world. They belonged exclusively to the Martial Emperor and encompassed both the rule and meaning of the pinnacle.

They swimmed around Ye Qingyu's body, constantly entangling and switching places with each other. The mysterious yellow vapor, on the other hand, merged perfectly with them, and the mantra of a hundred and eight characters suddenly appeared on the inner walls of the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. He was now being refined like an elixir.

Time ticked along slowly.

Ye Qingyu remained still in a meditative posture.

...

Two days later.

A figure leaped out from the [Fallen God Abyss] and landed stably on a column of rocks dozens of meters away from its entrance.

The figure could be seen stumbling about; he was Ye Qingyu.

He was covered in wounds and streaks of blood, giving him a wretched appearance.

He knew, however, that his real condition was not as bad as he looked. In fact, the exact opposite was true - he was in peak condition and full of power; he was now dozens of times stronger than when he had gone into the [Fallen God Abyss].

Most importantly, Ye Qingyu could clearly sense that his life force and origin power were now much stronger than before. Not only had he recovered all of his vitality and blood lost during his fight with Jiang Xiaohan, they now existed in larger volumes within his body now.

The arm that had been chopped off previously had now regenerated back.

Only his wounds were still not completely patched; after all, he had been wounded much too seriously.

He carried the [Cloud Top Cauldron] in his hand.

Ye Qingyu could not help but be amazed at the uniqueness of the cauldron. Its exterior was completely unscathed from the onslaught of the terrible cursed qi activity in the [Fallen God Abyss]; it had withstood the attack of the boundless qi activity for two whole days and nights.

At long last, the cursed murderous spirit weakend and disappeared.

Ye Qingyu did not know whether it was because the terrible presence deep in the bowels of the [Fallen God Abyss] was not completely awakened or due to another reason that it had returned to deep slumber and vanished after rampaging violently in the abyss for two days and two nights.

It all seemed very strange.

Even so, it was due to this fact that Ye Qingyu could walk out of the [Fallen God Abyss] alive.

In actual fact, he could have remained longer within the [Cloud Top Cauldron] until he had completely recovered from his wounds, but as he was worried about the domain rating, he chose to emerge earlier than planned.

The problem was that the entire field of [Black Demon Herbs] had already been completely destroyed.

Ye Qingyu did not manage to gather any [Black Demon Herbs] in the end, and had let a good opportunity slip from his hands.

He still had not completed the task stipulated in his test.

What should I do? Now that the last bit [Black Demon Herb]in the [Fallen God Abyss] at this location has been destroyed, there should be no more traces of the herb in the other sixteen districts anymore!

Ye Qingyu's teeth rattled with frustration.

He could not come with a good solution after pondering about the matter for a long while.

If he wanted to resume his attempt of completing the task stipulated in the assessment of the Alliance of Domains, he could only venture forth to the 17th and 18th districts, where there could still be some [Black Demon Herbs].

That said, when Ye Qingyu had searched for maps of the [Fallen God Abyss] in the administrative hall previously, he could only find that of the first sixteen districts in the archives. That meant that there were no known records of the 17th and 18th districts.

Looks like I can only go back to look for the Black Armor Race again. Perhaps they possess some sort of knowledge of the 17th district... Or maybe, they'll have some other way for me to accomplish my task or have other leads?

At this point in time, Ye Qingyu could only harbor the thought that luck would be on his side.

After making up his mind, he leaped up and left the border of the [Fallen God Abyss], advancing toward the desolated mountain ridge at the west of the 16th district.

...

After thirty minutes.

In the space above the desolation ridge where the Black Armor Race resided.

After passing through the torrential waves of Black Demon qi, Ye Qingyu could feel that thick evil blood qi pervaded the air.

Could it be that the Black Armor Race has been raided again?
Ye Qingyu thought.

His heart skipped a beat.

His figure blurred into a flash of silver as he dashed to the mountain slope in an instant.

What he saw shook him.

Deathly silence pervaded the entire camp of the Black Armor Race.

The air reeked of blood and a strange smell of decay. There was no soul to be seen, and a lake of blood had formed at a more even spot at the slope.

Dozens of desecrated corpses of warriors from the Black Armor Race were piled around the lake of blood, and sets of scale armor and broken blades and arrows were strewn all over the slope.

What happened?

Was the entire Black Armor Race massacred?
Ye Qingyu thought.

He was in a state of shock and surprise as he walked up the mountain slope.

Suddenly, a corpse that was covered with bloody stains and black mud caught his attention.

The corpse belonged to a solidly built warrior, but it was without a head. The scales on the back of the warrior had been shaved off with an extremely sharp blade. It seemed that the warrior had underwgone extreme torture before his death.

He picked up a loose piece of scale beside the corpse and noticed that the end of it which was cut off from its owners body had already been caked with a dark red fluid.

"
There's the scent of decay in this fluid...
"

Ye Qingyu frowned slightly before continuing to examine the broken scale in detail.

He then examined the black mud underneath his feet, which had already been mixed with blood from the victims. He noticed that there were traces of the same dark red fluid in the blood.

"
Could it be that the Black Armor Race was poisoned before being massacred?
"

The assailants obviously wanted to ensure that there would be no survivors to have come up with such a careful plan.

What sort of vengeance could have warranted such savagery?
Ye Qingyu thought.

Just as he was still perturbed by the entire turn of events, a few figures dashed out from the Black Demon qi.

"Who are you!?"

"Who goes there?"

"How dare you break into an area fenced off by the Black Demon Race!"

Four or five figures surrounded Ye Qingyu with lightning speed.

Ye Qingyu was a little shocked and cast his vision beyond the thick, haze-like demon qi. He could see a few figures wrapped in black vapor and could vaguely make out that they were dressed in black from head to toe.

Even though he could not see their faces or figures, he could sense that they possessed extremely great power, and that the black vapor around them to be from the same source and origin from the demon qi from the [Fallen God Abyss].

They were experts from the Black Demon Race.

"I'm just passing by," replied Ye Qingyu nonchalantly, with the same expression. He slowly channeled his icy power, and a faint icy haze slowly covered him like a muslin curtain. Even though his figure could still be seen, his face remained hidden.

"Passing by? Don't you know that this area is already under lockdown?" an expert clad in black said in a low, chilly tone as he took a few steps forward.

Ye Qingyu could feel many gazes upon him at this moment.

In the Black Demon Pool, it was very common for one to be covered in vapor, thus obscuring one's facial features. As such, the experts clad in black robes did not feel that it was strange in the least bit that they could not see Ye Qingyu's face.

"Are you from the Black Demon Race?" he asked directly.

Likewise, he cast his gaze on the few experts in black slowly advancing toward him. He realized that they held some broken scales and bones in their hands, and one of them was even holding a head.

Ye Qingyu instantly realized that the head was that of the chief of the Black Armor Race.

The chief of the Black Armor Race was beheaded?
he thought.

It seemed that this was no ordinary raid to seize the medicinal herbs from the Black Armor Race.

The experts repeatedly took measure of Ye Qingyu and exchanged a few words between themselves. Finally, one of them, who was shrouded in a thick cloud of vapor, said coldly, "We're a scout team from the Black Demon Race. We've come here specifically to investigate the massacre of the Black Armor Race three days ago. This area is now under lockdown. Since you've suddenly appeared, do you know anything about this incident?"

"The entire Black Armor Race has been exterminated? This... I don't know what happened. Three days ago, I bought a knife made of animal bone from the chief of the Black Armor Race. I've come here today with the mind to purchase some medicinal herbs from him," replied Ye Qingyu as he tossed the small knife, about the size of his palm, over.

The Black Demon Race expert received the knife and examined it carefully before replying, "Since that's the case, you'd better leave this area. It's now a restricted zone and you'll be escorted to the judicial hall of the Black Demon Pool as a suspect if you continue to linger here."
