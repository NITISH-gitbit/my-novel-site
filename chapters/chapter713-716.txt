Chapter 713:


Chapter 731 - Reappearance


Holding on to the last glimmer of hope, Ye Qingyu descended until he stood in front of the entrance to the Fallen God Abyss.

What he saw was an unfathomably massive sinkhole of a kilometer in diameter.

Extremely hard rocks which were black and gray in color were piled all around the sinkhole.

This was an extremely rare type of rock which could not only withstand the corrosion by the evil qi, but also slowly absorb the Black Demon qi and continually make use of it. After many years of accumulation, the originally spiritless and breathless rocks would begin to discharge traces of an extremely peculiar blood vessel qi and become as hard as divine iron.

Boom!

Billows of Black Demon qi spewed out.

Amid roars which sounded like they came from ancient beasts, Black Demon qi erupted from the abyss ceaselessly.

Standing less than a hundred meters from the edge of the sinkhole, Ye Qingyu frowned slightly.

Demon qi mist, which was as pitch-black as thick ink, reached into the clouds, the evil and cruel qi within spurting terrifying flames of suppression and slaughter, as though it was holding countless revenants captive. The entire place seemed to be saturated with a wicked aura and power.

The place gave one a feeling which was completely different from that in any other zone along the way.

The Fallen God Abyss was just like an entrance to hell.

Ye Qingyu's expression became a little grim as he looked at the Fallen God Abyss which was spurting black-colored demonic flames non-stop.

He did not have much of a choice whether or not to take this risk and explore below, for he could not possibly give up the only chance to find the Black Demon Herb.

Fortunately, he still possessed a few trump cards that could save his life.

If he truly suffered a mishap, the [Flash] and the [Ghost Shadows of Hell] could help him to escape from danger.

He slowly walked to the edge of the abyss.

Because of the suppression which the Black Demon qi enacted on an expert's yuan qi, it was highly likely that he would gradually lose his flying ability while diving down. To be safe, he opted to climb down the walls of the abyss instead.

With every flash of his figure, he would grab hold of a protruding rock below as if he was rock climbing. In this fashion of utmost caution, he entered the sinkhole slowly but surely.

After the time it took to drink a cup of tea.

He had descended approximately a kilometer along the cliff walls.

The abyss below him remained unfathomable.

The furiously surging Black Demon qi became increasingly dense and frightening. It resembled a savage demonic beast with its bloodied mouth wide open, frenziedly jumping up and down as it eagerly waited to devour the entire universe.

The power of this demon qi is becoming increasingly strange...

Ye Qingyu's heart turned heavy and his expression stiffened.

With both his legs treading on a seam that was only half a palm wide, there was a chance of misstepping if he shifted slightly. At the same time, because of the growing intensity of the Black Demon qi, his vision had become less than five meters in range. He certainly brought to mind a dinghy that was engulfed in a storm and could not make out its direction.

As he descended, he increasingly felt that the Black Demon qi, which was as if tens of millions of tentacles were wrapping around him and pulling him apart continuously, contained an extremely frightening power that was close to being a mystical law. By this time, the yuan qi in his dantian had become completely suppressed and inoperable, and was showing signs of freezing, like a surging boundless ocean which had suddenly turned into a dead sea.

It was as if his entire body had become entangled and trapped in a huge and tenacious spider web, and was completely unable to break free.

Good thing my powers of lightning and storm, as well as the [Supreme Ice Flame], haven't been suppressed...

Carefully inspecting the powers in his body, he discovered that, aside from his yuan qi, his other powers did not seem affected by the Black Demon qi.

He once again discharged consciousness power to observe the situation in the surroundings.

Although the Black Demon qi did engender some suppression on his consciousness power, his spirit had long attained the pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm and he was thus able to perceive all things within a kilometer of him as usual.

After roughly surveying the terrain, he discovered no apparent danger.

Feeling slightly at ease, he continued to descend along the cliff walls.

However, his speed had clearly lowered ever since his yuan qi was completely suppressed.

A full two hours later, he had descended only another two kilometers.

The Black Demon qi below him had been repeatedly quenched until it was extremely pure and rich. Compared to the thick smoke earlier, it was more like a material black flame which continually changed form and licked upward before devouring him in an instant. The skin and muscles throughout his body felt pain as though they were being continually cleaved and ground, while even his bones and vessels felt like they had been tightly seized by the Black Demon qi and were being pulled apart and twisted.

He had no choice but to turn into a dragon and rely on the silver dragon form's powerful physical body to withstand the Black Demon qi.

But even so, the demon qi that wrapped around his body in black flame form felt like an ancient divine mountain which was holding him down and making movement extremely difficult.

Moreover, the closer he got to the base of the Fallen God Abyss, the clearer he could hear the devilish and bestial howls that came from the depths.

This was an extremely shrilling noise that sounded as if thousands of demons were howling and wailing.

"Judging from the noise, the ground shouldn't be far..."

He clenched his teeth and operated the powers of lightning and the [Supreme Ice Flame].

A thin layer of ice mist and purple lightning emerged on his dragon scales, serving as a film layer that emitted an ice and electric mist to keep the Black Demon qi out of his body.

His dragon body then took a leap and continued to proceed down.

...

At the same time.

At the entrance of the Fallen God Abyss.

Two beams of flowing light suddenly came through the void.

Two figures undulated briefly before materializing.

Standing on the left side was a middle-aged man dressed in a pale yellow and black brocade robe. He had a lean and extremely pale face, and below his chin were three long strands of black beard. As his oblique and long eyes squinted, an extremely malicious cold light flashed across his pupils.

This was none other than Huang Tayun, one of the supervisors of the Violet Gold Divine Office front court in Sunrise City.

The woman beside him was wearing a scarlet-red silk dress. She had a slim and graceful body, an enchanting beauty, and eyes which gleamed with a charm of their own. At the same time, as a strange woman with a frosty dignity, she combined charm with iciness into an extremely peculiar temperament.

This was none other than Ye Qungyu's childhood sweetheart - Jiang Xiaohan.

"Heh heh, I've finally lured that son of a bitch into this trap." A delight flashed across Huang Tayun's eyes. "I've succeeded in my plan and completed your request. The rest will be up to you, Miss Jiang."

"You've done well this time. My master's advance payment of a third of your reward hasn't been in vain..." There was a stateliness and chill in Jiang Xiaohan's voice as she stared fixedly at the entrance to the Fallen God Abyss. "However, if you want to claim the other two-thirds, you'll have to listen carefully to my instructions for the next task. You'd better make sure to not act on your own accord and spoil the whole plan. Otherwise, don't blame me for being uncivil."

"That's natural..." Huang Tayun's pupils flashed as he readily consented.

He was clearly a little afraid of Jiang Xiaohan's strength.

However, it was unclear whether his reply meant that he wanted the other two-thirds of his reward or that he would listen to her instructions.

The statuses of these two people at present were completely different from those at the beginning.

After several rounds of cooperation, Jiang Xiaohan's vigor seemed to have gradually and imperceptibly suppressed Huang Tayun, allowing her to take over the dominant role.

Her fiery dress danced in the air.

She suddenly flew up as trippingly as a fire butterfly fluttering its wings.

"Ye Qingyu, let's bring a nice ending to our mutual grievances right here and now..."

The next moment.

She turned into a cloud of Black Demon qi and blended perfectly with the spewing Black Demon qi before plunging into the Fallen God Abyss.

An astoundment flashed in Huang Tayun's eyes as he remained standing where he was and watched the figure jump into the abyss.

It had not even been a month since the first time he met Jiang Xiaohan. He never imagined that this demoness' strength would advance by such leaps and  bounds, completely surpassing the progress limits of a common expert.

"It appears that this demoness has mastered the Black Demon Race's magical abilities to a great extent. Could she be one of them? That's impossible... she's simply too eccentric... I must be careful..." Amid his shock, Huang Tayun seemed to think of something that caused a sinister smile to emerge on his face.

His figure flickered and turned into a beam of flowing light that disappeared from the Fallen God Abyss.

...

A while later.

In the camp of the Black Armor Race.

A harsh smell of blood and a murderous spirit shrouded the air above the hill.

The slope on which tents had gathered had by this time been turned into a blood lake.

The crippled bodies and corpses of the Black Armor Race experts were scattered everywhere together with their broken scale armors, from which wisps of Black Demon qi effused and rose into the demon qi, which was like a black sea of clouds, in the void, accompanied by a shrilling and terrifying hissing noise.

In the distance.

Huang Tayun walked while holding his sword behind him.

Soaked in fresh blood and bursting with cruel qi, the longsword continually dripped blood water onto the ground.

Containing Black Demon qi, the blood water seeped into the black mud and gave off a putrid smell.

Huang Tayun trod on the strewn corpses of the Black Armor Race experts as he walked forth with eyes that gleamed with an extremely vicious brilliance.

After taking dozen-odd steps, he arrived in front of the Black Armor Race leader's body.

The latter's face had turned green and his facial orifices discharged an extremely odd dark-red liquid, indicating that he had been badly poisoned.

"You... We trusted you so much... How dare you..." Laying crumpled on the ground and gasping feebly for air, the elder desperately struggled but could neither stand up nor retaliate, and thus revealed an expression of extreme shock and anger.

It turned out that the person whom the elder had divulged to Ye Qingyu to be purchasing the Black Demon Herbs at a high price was none other than Huang Tayun, who was walking toward him with a sword in hand right now. The Black Armor Race's mention of the Fallen God Abyss to Ye Qingyu was actually also arranged by Huang Tayun, who had paid a high price to buy their cooperation over.

However, the leader of the Black Armor Race totally did not expect Huang Tayun to return after the matter was done and conduct a surprise attack. The latter had silently poisoned the Black Armor Race with a toxin which had an inhibiting effect on them, causing them to become completely resistance-less, before he struck out and exterminated the entire race.

His eyes flickering a bloodthirsty red glow, Huang Tayun did not respond to the leader's rebuke.

A piercingly cold sword light.

The longsword in his hand slowly perforated the leader's chest bit by bit like a blunt knife sinking into a piece of meat.

"Ahhh..." The leader wailed in pain.

========================================

Chapter 714:


Chapter 732 Keep Them All


The Black Armor Race had always been a race whose yuan qi cultivation was weak but physical cultivation was extremely strong. This was best represented by the expert whose physical body became saintly all those years ago. However, it was precisely because of their weak yuan qi cultivation that their resistance toward poisonous forces was very weak.

Generally speaking, even if it was a common poison that invaded their organs and blood vessels, they would quickly lose their combat strength as they would find it difficult to swiftly dispel the poison from their bodies.

This was exactly what was happening to the leader of the Black Armor Race.

Conversely, Huang Tayun was as strong as he always was and the sword in his hand was not of an ordinary grade. As such, he would have been able to impale and cleave an even tougher body, and the terrifying power contained in his sword was sufficient to mince the five internal organs of a wounded person.

He dug the longsword inch by inch into the leader's chest.

His eyes revealed great delight as he heard the leader's wailing voice. He seemed to very much enjoy the pleasure derived from this sort of bloody way of killing.

Subsequently, he pulled the longsword out of the leader's chest at an extremely gradual rate, then revealed a contemptuous expression as he stamped on the leader's head as if he was stepping on a dirty and smelly piece of rubbish.

"Hahahaha, as they say, people die for wealth the way birds die for food. It's a bit too funny that you're talking about trust in the face of benefits." He used his longsword to shear the scale armor on the leader's back as he let out a ghastly strange laugh, "How many origin crystals did I have to waste on you idiots to get this matter done? But fortunately, you all didn't f*ck it up, or otherwise I wouldn't have allowed you all to die so easily. Now, I have to shut all of you up for the rest of eternity in order to claim the other two-thirds of my due reward. Hoho, so what if I take away your worthless lives?"

"You're... so mean.... You.... We're a auxilliary race of the descendants of the Black Armor Race and are under its protection, you... You think your end will be better than ours? The Black Demon Race will definitely hunt you down and make you die a terrible death!"

The Black Demon Race people began to howl and curse as the pain became unbearable.

Huang Tayun did not seem at all enraged by the leader and instead laughed even more wildly.

As if bored of the toy beneath his feet, he struck across with his sword and beheaded the leader without saying anything else. He then gave a casual kick and sent the head flying dozens of meters like a rubber ball.

"Is that so? It's certainly a huge crime to have destroyed the entire Black Armor Race. Perhaps the Alliance of Domains will be alerted, while the Black Demon Race will naturally take revenge for you all. However, it won't be me they look for, hahahaha!" The demon qi- and evil blood qi-filled hills resounded with his unbridled laughter.

Subsequently, he picked a few spots to deliberately falsify traces in.

After doing all this, his figure disappeared above the wilderness.

...

Ye Qingyu finally reached the bottom of the Fallen God Abyss.

Liquid-like Black Demon qi surged frenziedly in the surroundings, letting out a ferocious scream that was truly suffocating. It no longer became possible to withstand the frightening power contained in the Black Demon qi simply by operating the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] to turn into a silver Sky Dragon. Ye Qingyu had reverted to his human form, with a layer of purple lightning circulating on his body. It was power drawn from the chaotic thunder liquid left behind by the Lightning Emperor.

As a legacy of a martial emperor, the lightning power contained a supreme martial power of laws and was thus able to withstand the frightening power of the Black Demon qi. It was why Ye Qingyu was able to keep going at the bottom of the Fallen God Abyss.

Without it, there was a chance he would have perished somewhere along the way.

"This place is truly terrifying..."

As he surveyed the surrounding environment with lightning-filled eyes, he could confirm that even a half step Immortal Step realm expert would be instantly turned into ashes and smoke in this place.

With the help of the purple lightning's power, he could clearly see up to fifty-odd meters in front of him.

His current position was on top of a strange round rock which was several hundred meters tall.

The surface of this white round rock was extremely glossy and hard. It remained completely unmoved even within the surging Black Demon qi, and furthermore, its surface emitted a faint silver mist which contained a strange spiritual energy that kept the Black Demon qi away.

"This rock is a little odd."

He crouched down and knocked gently on its metal-like surface.

Growing more curious, he generated a force in his palm and pressed it on the surface. Given his present strength, he could even break a divine weapon by using one finger. But instead, there were no marks left on the rock, and a feedback force even surged forth and nearly sent him flying.

"Could it be some kind of divine iron?" he muttered to himself.

He walked down along the rock.

The white rock was a hundred meters tall and took on a spherical shape. The situation was indeed odd.

"Huh? There's a hole here? And two..." Ye Qingyu discovered in shock that there were two large holes of four to five meters in diameter in the middle part of the rock that led into the dark interior.

Out of curiosity, he decided to enter one of them. After all, these type of caves usually contained a great amount of Yin qi and was thus suitable for Black Demon Herbs to grow in.

A while later.

"I never thought the middle part of this rock would be completely empty... Dammit, my luck's terrible." Feeling a little disappointed, Ye Qingyu could not help but curse.

The inner walls of the cave were as glossy as a mirror and were not made from metal but instead a material superior to that. There was not a single crevice or patch of soil to speak of, and thus Black Demon Herbs could not possibly grow - not even a speck of moss or dust could be found. It was as if someone cleaned the place every day such that it was immaculate and shockingly clean.

After walking out of the cave, he looked back.

The giant round white rock wavered between real and unreal, and its entirety could not be seen clearly under the cover of the dense Black Demon qi.

"This rock is very odd. Perhaps it's highly valuable."

Ye Qingyu's heart skipped a beat.

His primary objective for venturing down might have been to pick Black Demon Herbs, but since the abyss was so dangerous and mystical, he hoped to have some other gains as well. From the looks of it, this kind of incomparably hard rock should be worth a fortune - it should at least be comparable to the stalagmites in the Underground Moonlight Immortal Palace of the Clear River Domain, even though the latter was unmistakably a legacy of the former Lightning Emperor, Qin Ming.

"Keep it for me!"

Ye Qingyu summoned the [Cloud Top Cauldron] from his dantian world and chanted a 108-word mantra. An incomparable suction power poured out and kept the rock, of a hundred meters in diameter, into the storage space within.

The storage space of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] was like a small world of its own that could hold every object in the universe. These days, Ye Qingyu had kept all kinds of weird objects within, but it never became congested and still had lots of space.

"Heh heh, as they say, one must never return empty-handed having entered a treasure mountain."

He laughed.

After this was done, he proceeded forth in search of Black Demon Herbs among the boundless tide of Black Demon qi.

The referable information of the administration hall did not provide an explanation of the Fallen God Abyss, and neither did the map which the Black Armor Race gave him describe the bottom of the abyss. Although impatient, Ye Qingyu could only probe slowly and try his luck in different places.

Of course, he dared not be negligent about the danger mentioned by the elder.

After all, this was a place where saints had fallen.

The Immortal Step realm consisted of nine steps, of which the ninth was the highest step before one became a Saint, and an ordinary Saint nonetheless. One would then have to increase their courage and steel themself by going through all kinds of tribulations before one could become a Great Saint. Among the countless experts of the Vast Thousand Domains, there were many talented heroes and blood lineages of different races, yet only a handful of them would ultimately become a Great Saint. This was indicative of how frightening the strength of a Great Saint was.

Since the Fallen God Abyss could kill even a Great Saint, there had to be something absolutely weird about it.

Ye Qingyu did not dare to be negligent, as confident and well-equipped with all kinds of life-preserving methods as he was.

Lightning power wreathed his body, forming a thick purple lightning armor which covered every inch of his body, including his eyes, mouth, and nose, like dragon scales. Only this way would he not be swept up by the frenziedly surging Black Demon qi as he walked forth step after step.

The environment at the bottom of the Fallen God Abyss was very strange and seemed like that of a place of death.

However, after a while, Ye Qingyu saw that fertile divine soil was scattered in the crevices of the black and thick rocks.

This enlivened him.

Where there was fertile divine soil, there would likely be divine herbs such as the Black Demon Herb - at the very least, it meant that this place was suitable for vegetation to grow.

Ye Qingyu continued to walk forward.

A huge white rocky isolated peak appeared in his line of sight.

Thump thump!

He knocked on the rock.

"Hmm, this is rather similar to the strange round rock from earlier... No, their materials are exactly the same. This contains a strange spiritual energy and must be unusual..." Standing in front of the isolated peak, he felt terribly shocked.

The isolated peak was no more than ten-odd meters wide. One end was buried in the crevices of the black rocks while the other end ascended into the vault of heaven, and the middle section was slightly bent such that its actual height could not be seen clearly. At first glance, it seemed like a giant curved long knife with a very weird structure.

"Why are the structures of these white rocks always so odd... Nevermind, keep it!"

He once again summoned the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and kept the white rock within it.

There would be time after he got out to study this thing and find out what its purpose was.

But instinct informed him that this was no simple plaything.

He proceeded ahead.

Along the way, he discovered to his amazement that there were many more of these white rocks, which came in all sorts of sizes, shapes, and strange structures. The larger ones were several kilometers long while the smaller ones were about half of his height. They were each as glossy as white jade stones, and contained a strange spiritual energy which he could not identify.

They were scattered everywhere in a disorderly fashion. Some were half-buried under gravel and soil, some were stuck in the stone walls, while others were swept floating several dozen meters high in the air by chaotic tides of Black Demon qi... A very strange situation indeed. It was as if the Fallen God Abyss specialized in producing these odd-looking rocks.

Ye Qingyu was most unceremonious. As he proceeded forth, he would keep every single white rock he came across, regardless of its size, into the [Cloud Top Cauldron].

Chapter 715:


Chapter 733 The Self-Praising Demon God
As he kept keeping, Ye Qingyu could no longer remember exactly how many of the strange white rocks he had collected. In any case, the storage space in the [Cloud Top Cauldron] remained plentiful and showed no sign of being filled up.
Slightly less than an hour passed in a twinkling.
Ye Qingyu finally saw vegetation at the bottom of the [Fallen God Abyss].
It was a strange black plant that was only half a palm in height. Resembling a wheat seedling, it had extremely few roots and grew in several rock crevices and cliff feet, where it could not be swept away by the raging tides of the Black Demon qi. It was very limited in numbers, each containing spiritual energy.
"This should be [Dark Fern], the 11th-ranked plant on the Demon Plant List. The info says that it's extremely effective at healing toxic injuries, and can also serve as a divine herb and be refined into healing pills. A treasure indeed."
In no time, Ye Qingyu was able to discern the origin of this strange black vegetation.
"Keep!"
He raised the [Cloud Top Cauldron] once more.
Since it was a treasure, he would certainly not let it go.
He picked and kept into the [Cloud Top Cauldron] every [Dark Fern] he saw along the way.
The discovery of the [Dark Ferns] was clearly a fantastic signal, for it meant that vegetation could grow in the hellish [Fallen God Abyss]. If [Dark Ferns] could grow, then it was certainly possible that [Black Demon Herbs] would appear.
His confidence was greatly boosted.
He advanced forth.
He ran into a series of several other plants, some of which he had seen on the administration hall's list, while others were unknown. However, every one of them contained a spiritual energy of different intensities, and was clearly not of ordinary grade. He kept them all into the [Cloud Top Cauldron] without discrimination.
In his current state, he was like a crazy bandit who grabbed whatever he saw.
"Hmm? Is this... a [Blood Spirit Lily]? How could there be this sort of treasure in this wretched place? There isn't even any water here. Legend has it that this kind of divine herb must be grown from the blood of a demon god... Haha, let's not think too much, and just keep it for now."
"Hmm? A [Demon Feather Flower]? Ha, keep!"
"Is this the fruit of a [Serene Cloud Rye]? Ha, keep!"
"[Mildly Fragrant Orchid]... Keep!]
"Heavens, there's even [Crystal Camellias]? I shouldn't be mistaken... Keep!"
"Keep!"
"This is... Ha, keep!"
He had totally not expected there to be so many rare plants, every one of which was on the Demon Plant List, at the bottom of the [Fallen God Abyss]. The trip had truly been a fruitful one. He could only come up with one explanation as he thought it over - these varied divine herbs had not been picked because nobody had dared to venture down here for too long a time.
Unfortunately, he never saw the [Black Demon Herb] all this while.
But he was no longer anxious.
Based on his observations along the way, he felt certain that [Black Demon Herbs] would grow in this kind of environment, and therefore that he had found the right place this time.
Suddenly, a dark-red beam of flowing light cut through the distant raging tides of Black Demon qi and then disappeared in a flash.
"Huh? What's that?"
Ye Qingyu acutely detected the change.
Could it be some organism?
This was the first time he had seen movement, apart from that of the Black Demon qi, since he arrived at the bottom of the [Fallen God Abyss].
The good thing was that he did not perceive any dangerous aura on that dark-red beam of flowing light which disappeared as soon as it appeared.
Still, he exercised greater vigilance.
After all, the [Fallen God Abyss] was an inauspicious place where even a Great Saint would perish.
However, for a period of time that followed, he had a perpetual strange feeling that a pair of eyes was secretly and silently watching him. Upon paying greater attention to this vaguely perceptible feeling, he detected an aura which would make one's hair stand on end. It felt as if a demon god was slowly approaching its prey.
"Could this be the danger which the Black Armor Race spoke of?"
He was beginning to feel uneasy.
With utmost caution, he operated the purple lightning power and gritted his teeth as he continued forth.
Finally, after 15 minutes, he walked across a marsh and saw the presence of [Black Demon Herbs] in a plot of muddy soil.
"I can't be seeing things, right...? Are these really [Black Demon Herbs]?" He quickened his footsteps and emitted light from his eyes upon seeing an acre of land on which black plants that resembled the tails of foxes were densely grown. On closer inspection, he discovered that the broad leaves on every stalk had nine petals and were red and black in color. These were certainly the [Black Demon Herbs] which he had been searching for.
He became excited all over.
"So many... Haha, this is, as they say, a case of finding something easily after wearing out one's sturdy shoes to find it." He ran wildly forth. "I didn't see wrongly, it really is... God truly helps those who help themselves. I'll not only have enough to fulfill the task but can also sell the rest for a lot of money."
He arrived beside the field of herbs at lightning speed.
Things were a lot clearer at close distance.
"Hmm? These [Black Demon Herbs]... Why are the edges of the leaves dark red in color? Strange, this was not mentioned in the info. Could these be a variant?"
Ye Qingyu was a little puzzled.
He plucked a stalk and was shocked by what he saw.
The roots of the stalk were filled with dark-red flowing light and seemed to be floundering about. More incredibly, the earth around the roots was also dark-red, as if the stalk had been pulled out from a pool of blood.
He only now noticed that the soil beneath the field was like viscous blood that emitted a glittering brilliance and possessed a strange spiritual energy which was extremely similar to that of the white rocks.
The matter was a little bizarre.
The only thing he could confirm was that it was indeed [Black Demon Herbs] which grew on the field. He guessed that the dark-red soil was the reason why they were modified.
The problem was that there was no guarantee that the modified [Black Demon Herbs] would fulfill the test requirements.
He was a little uncertain.
Just then...
A cloud of Black Demon qi silently tumbled behind him and suddenly turned into a black ancient rune longsword which resembled a serpent hiding in the dark. It subsequently charged toward his back at lightning speed.
Chi!
It was the sound of a sharp weapon perforating a muscle.
Instantly flashing like a flowing light, Ye Qingyu took evasive action as soon as the black ancient formation longsword made contact with his skin.
"Who goes there?"
Like a purple dancing snake, his power of lightning instantly turned into a crepe myrtle net that covered across the backline.
"Chuckle, we meet again, Brother Qingyu." A burst of familiar enchanting laughter rang out from nowhere. As if alive, the surrounding clouds and clusters of Black Demon qi seethed and tumbled as they turned into different and ever-changing phantoms, accompanied by shrilling roars and howls which could rip one's heart and soul.
Jiang Xiaohan?
With his body covered in lightning armor, Ye Qingyu quickly retreated and created a distance.
The suddenly-emerging voice sounded completely like Jiang Xiaohan. This astounded Ye Qingyu because, given her strength, she should not be able to enter a place like this, and the surprise attack earlier...
He felt his back burning searingly, clearly as a result of the surprise attack that had perforated his lightning armor and injured his body. Through the resulting wound, a strange power was continually entering his body at present.
"Hoho, Brother Qingyu. Surprised?"
Jiang Xiaohan's voice rang out once more.
This time, he could confirm with absolute certainty that the surprise attacker was indeed his childhood sweetheart.
The Black Demon qi ahead surged frenziedly and gathered into a shapely figure that was graceful like no other. However, like a phantom of smoke billows, it seemed as if it could be dispersed by the wind at any time. On the figure gradually appeared and materialized a face which was no different from a normal person's. It had a fair complexion and utmost grace, yet carried a killing intent on its frosty expression. This was certainly Jiang Xiaohan.
"You... how it's possible for you to come here?"
Ye Qingyu could not help asking.
The Jiang Xiaohan in front of him was somewhat unfamiliar not only because of her aura but more so her strength, which made him feel greatly threatened. Her strange frame, which constantly alternated between illusion and substance, was adequate proof that she was no longer the birdbrain of former days and that her strength had reached a certain level.
"Why can't I?" Jiang's face was one-third delight, one-third frosty killing intent, and one-fourth arrogance and mockery. Laughing, she looked at Ye and continued, "Is it because, in Brother Qingyu's eyes, Xiaohan must forever remain like a loach and stay in the mire? Can't Xiaohan follow you and explore this vast and infinitely exciting world? You've always looked down on Xiaohan deep inside, am I right?"
Ye did not reply to such senseless questions.
This was not his first time facing a radically-changed her.
"Are you from the Black Demon race?" He was shocked like never before when he saw her manipulating the Black Demon qi easily and adroitly. Only the lineage and magical technique of the Black Demon race was able to manipulate this qi, which was left by the martial emperor who built the Black Demon Pool. This had been the case without exception since antiquity.
The fact that she could manipulate the Black Demon qi proved that she was from the Black Demon race.
However...
He clearly knew her origin. She was certainly not from the lineage of the Black Demon race.
What exactly is going on?
Facing him.
"Hoho, who says only the Black Demon Race can manipulate the Blood Demon qi?" A monstrous arrogance circulated in Jiang's eyes as she looked smilingly at Ye Qingyu as if she was meeting an old friend. That smile was noticeably filled with a contempt which was heartfelt rather than deliberate. "Mediocre people are ignorant of the true meaning of the strength in this world, and thus believe that only the Black Demon Race can manipulate Black Demon qi. They don't know that in the eyes of the true demon gods, all strength lead to the same end and are but one. Master that one and master everything."
Ye Qingyu frowned.
Xiaohan is actually praising herself as a demon god?
What exactly has happened to her body?
Compared to the last time we met, she has increased her strength by too much and has gained the dignified aura of a superior. She has changed radically from that time when she was trembling and kneeling at the feet of Ao Tianzun. Could she have escaped from his control? Or... found a new backer?
Chapter 733 The Self-Praising Demon God


As he kept keeping, Ye Qingyu could no longer remember exactly how many of the strange white rocks he had collected. In any case, the storage space in the [Cloud Top Cauldron] remained plentiful and showed no sign of being filled up.

Slightly less than an hour passed in a twinkling.

Resembling a wheat seedling, it had extremely few roots and grew in several rock crevices and cliff feet, where it could not be swept away by the raging tides of the Black Demon qi.

"This should be [Dark Fern], the 11th-ranked plant on the Demon Plant List. The info says that it's extremely effective at healing toxic injuries, and can also serve as a divine herb and be refined into healing pills. A treasure indeed."

In no time, Ye Qingyu was able to discern the origin of this strange black vegetation.

"Keep!"

He raised the [Cloud Top Cauldron] once more.

Since it was a treasure, he would certainly not let it go.

He picked and kept into the [Cloud Top Cauldron] every [Dark Fern] he saw along the way.

The discovery of the [Dark Ferns] was clearly a fantastic signal, for it meant that vegetation could grow in the hellish [Fallen God Abyss]. If [Dark Ferns] could grow, then it was certainly possible that [Black Demon Herbs] would appear.

His confidence was greatly boosted.

He advanced forth.

He ran into a series of several other plants, some of which he had seen on the administration hall's list, while others were unknown. However, every one of them contained a spiritual energy of different intensities, and was clearly not of ordinary grade. He kept them all into the [Cloud Top Cauldron] without discrimination.

In his current state, he was like a crazy bandit who grabbed whatever he saw.

"Hmm? Is this... a [Blood Spirit Lily]? How could there be this sort of treasure in this wretched place? There isn't even any water here. Legend has it that this kind of divine herb must be grown from the blood of a demon god... Haha, let's not think too much, and just keep it for now."

"Hmm? A [Demon Feather Flower]? Ha, keep!"

"Is this the fruit of a [Serene Cloud Rye]? Ha, keep!"

"[Mildly Fragrant Orchid]... Keep!]

"Heavens, there's even [Crystal Camellias]? I shouldn't be mistaken... Keep!"

"Keep!"

"This is... Ha, keep!"

He had totally not expected there to be so many rare plants, every one of which was on the Demon Plant List, at the bottom of the [Fallen God Abyss]. The trip had truly been a fruitful one. He could only come up with one explanation as he thought it over - these varied divine herbs had not been picked because nobody had dared to venture down here for too long a time.

Unfortunately, he never saw the [Black Demon Herb] all this while.

But he was no longer anxious.

Based on his observations along the way, he felt certain that [Black Demon Herbs] would grow in this kind of environment, and therefore that he had found the right place this time.

Suddenly, a dark-red beam of flowing light cut through the distant raging tides of Black Demon qi and then disappeared in a flash.

"Huh? What's that?"

Ye Qingyu acutely detected the change.

Could it be some organism?

This was the first time he had seen movement, apart from that of the Black Demon qi, since he arrived at the bottom of the [Fallen God Abyss].

The good thing was that he did not perceive any dangerous aura on that dark-red beam of flowing light which disappeared as soon as it appeared.

Still, he exercised greater vigilance.

After all, the [Fallen God Abyss] was an inauspicious place where even a Great Saint would perish.

However, for a period of time that followed, he had a perpetual strange feeling that a pair of eyes was secretly and silently watching him. Upon paying greater attention to this vaguely perceptible feeling, he detected an aura which would make one's hair stand on end. It felt as if a demon god was slowly approaching its prey.

"Could this be the danger which the Black Armor Race spoke of?"

He was beginning to feel uneasy.

With utmost caution, he operated the purple lightning power and gritted his teeth as he continued forth.

Finally, after 15 minutes, he walked across a marsh and saw the presence of [Black Demon Herbs] in a plot of muddy soil.

"I can't be seeing things, right...? Are these really [Black Demon Herbs]?" He quickened his footsteps and emitted light from his eyes upon seeing an acre of land on which black plants that resembled the tails of foxes were densely grown. On closer inspection, he discovered that the broad leaves on every stalk had nine petals and were red and black in color. These were certainly the [Black Demon Herbs] which he had been searching for.

He became excited all over.

"So many... Haha, this is, as they say, a case of finding something easily after wearing out one's sturdy shoes to find it." He ran wildly forth. "I didn't see wrongly, it really is... God truly helps those who help themselves. I'll not only have enough to fulfill the task but can also sell the rest for a lot of money."

He arrived beside the field of herbs at lightning speed.

Things were a lot clearer at close distance.

"Hmm? These [Black Demon Herbs]... Why are the edges of the leaves dark red in color? Strange, this was not mentioned in the info. Could these be a variant?"

Ye Qingyu was a little puzzled.

He plucked a stalk and was shocked by what he saw.

The roots of the stalk were filled with dark-red flowing light and seemed to be floundering about. More incredibly, the earth around the roots was also dark-red, as if the stalk had been pulled out from a pool of blood.

He only now noticed that the soil beneath the field was like viscous blood that emitted a glittering brilliance and possessed a strange spiritual energy which was extremely similar to that of the white rocks.

The matter was a little bizarre.

The only thing he could confirm was that it was indeed [Black Demon Herbs] which grew on the field. He guessed that the dark-red soil was the reason why they were modified.

The problem was that there was no guarantee that the modified [Black Demon Herbs] would fulfill the test requirements.

He was a little uncertain.

Just then...

A cloud of Black Demon qi silently tumbled behind him and suddenly turned into a black ancient rune longsword which resembled a serpent hiding in the dark. It subsequently charged toward his back at lightning speed.

Chi!

It was the sound of a sharp weapon perforating a muscle.

Instantly flashing like a flowing light, Ye Qingyu took evasive action as soon as the black ancient formation longsword made contact with his skin.

"Who goes there?"

Like a purple dancing snake, his power of lightning instantly turned into a crepe myrtle net that covered across the backline.

"Chuckle, we meet again, Brother Qingyu." A burst of familiar enchanting laughter rang out from nowhere. As if alive, the surrounding clouds and clusters of Black Demon qi seethed and tumbled as they turned into different and ever-changing phantoms, accompanied by shrilling roars and howls which could rip one's heart and soul.

Jiang Xiaohan?

With his body covered in lightning armor, Ye Qingyu quickly retreated and created a distance.

The suddenly-emerging voice sounded completely like Jiang Xiaohan. This astounded Ye Qingyu because, given her strength, she should not be able to enter a place like this, and the surprise attack earlier...

He felt his back burning searingly, clearly as a result of the surprise attack that had perforated his lightning armor and injured his body. Through the resulting wound, a strange power was continually entering his body at present.

"Hoho, Brother Qingyu. Surprised?"

Jiang Xiaohan's voice rang out once more.

This time, he could confirm with absolute certainty that the surprise attacker was indeed his childhood sweetheart.

The Black Demon qi ahead surged frenziedly and gathered into a shapely figure that was graceful like no other. However, like a phantom of smoke billows, it seemed as if it could be dispersed by the wind at any time. On the figure gradually appeared and materialized a face which was no different from a normal person's. It had a fair complexion and utmost grace, yet carried a killing intent on its frosty expression. This was certainly Jiang Xiaohan.

"You... how it's possible for you to come here?"

Ye Qingyu could not help asking.

The Jiang Xiaohan in front of him was somewhat unfamiliar not only because of her aura but more so her strength, which made him feel greatly threatened. Her strange frame, which constantly alternated between illusion and substance, was adequate proof that she was no longer the birdbrain of former days and that her strength had reached a certain level.

"Why can't I?" Jiang's face was one-third delight, one-third frosty killing intent, and one-fourth arrogance and mockery. Laughing, she looked at Ye and continued, "Is it because, in Brother Qingyu's eyes, Xiaohan must forever remain like a loach and stay in the mire? Can't Xiaohan follow you and explore this vast and infinitely exciting world? You've always looked down on Xiaohan deep inside, am I right?"

Ye did not reply to such senseless questions.

This was not his first time facing a radically-changed her.

"Are you from the Black Demon race?" He was shocked like never before when he saw her manipulating the Black Demon qi easily and adroitly. Only the lineage and magical technique of the Black Demon race was able to manipulate this qi, which was left by the martial emperor who built the Black Demon Pool. This had been the case without exception since antiquity.

The fact that she could manipulate the Black Demon qi proved that she was from the Black Demon race.

However...

He clearly knew her origin. She was certainly not from the lineage of the Black Demon race.

What exactly is going on?

Facing him.

"Hoho, who says only the Black Demon Race can manipulate the Blood Demon qi?" A monstrous arrogance circulated in Jiang's eyes as she looked smilingly at Ye Qingyu as if she was meeting an old friend. That smile was noticeably filled with a contempt which was heartfelt rather than deliberate. "Mediocre people are ignorant of the true meaning of the strength in this world, and thus believe that only the Black Demon Race can manipulate Black Demon qi. They don't know that in the eyes of the true demon gods, all strength lead to the same end and are but one. Master that one and master everything."

Ye Qingyu frowned.

Xiaohan is actually praising herself as a demon god?

What exactly has happened to her body?

Compared to the last time we met, she has increased her strength by too much and has gained the dignified aura of a superior. She has changed radically from that time when she was trembling and kneeling at the feet of Ao Tianzun. Could she have escaped from his control? Or... found a new backer?

Chapter 716:


Chapter 734 A War in Name Only


"After I let you off the last time, why didn't you see sense and stay away from me?"

Ye Qingyu looked impatiently at Jiang Xiaohan and his tone gradually became cold, annoyed that he was being impeded at a pivotal moment with time pressing and just as he was about to obtain the [Black Demon Herb].

"The last time?" An insane and scorching expression flickered in Jiang Xiaohan's elegant pupils.

The smile on her fair and beautiful face disappeared instantly. Her black hair fluttered wildly like a black serpent and her knife-sharp stare seemed as if they wanted to pierce through Ye Qingyu's entire being as she said in a chilly voice, "It's precisely because of the last time that you must die today... when the name [Empress of All Things] resounds throughout the Vast Thousand Domains, I don't want anyone to know about my past low moments."

"[The Empress of All Things]?" Ye Qingyu was taken aback.

Jiang Xiaohan laughed once more.

The Black Demon qi around her began to seethe unbridledly and howl like a raging billow. Eventually, she could not help laughing and spoke in a voice like that of a bellowing demon, "Hahaha, that's right, the [Empress of All Things] is the imperial honorific title I've prepared for myself. Ye Qingyu, you're the first person to know about it, and so can consider it your good fortune before you die in peace. When I inevitably become the martial emperor and rule the Vast Thousand Domains, I'll be the one and only sovereign whose followers prosper and whose defiers die."

Ye Qingyu gently shook his head as he looked at her appearance, "You're... so childish."

"Childish?" Jiang Xiaohan snorted. "Hoho, maybe you don't understand what kind of power I've mastered... Hoho, to tell you the truth, I really don't want you to die, and would rather you live and witness my rise to the top. When I ascend the throne, it'd be so nice if you're the first person beneath my feet..."

Ye Qingyu frowned.

He vaguely felt that Jiang Xiaohan's mental state had gone haywire.

Facing him, Jiang Xiaohan continued to mutter to herself.

"You know, when we were young and you plucked me flowers, caught me birds, took care of those punks, combed my hair, and sang for me... I imagined a wonderful future when I reached the absolute summit while you protected me. Unfortunately, you gave up on yourself and lost your worth, and so I had to abandon you and go alone to White Deer Academy. Do you still bear a grudge for that? But isn't it normal for worthless people to be forsaken? When you later rebounded and performed that eagerly, wasn't it to prove a point to me? I'd prepared to accept you back, but you failed to appreciate my kindness."

"What are you trying to say? I have no time for your nonsense." Ye Qingyu was fully prepared to strike.

The power of the chaotic thunder liquid around his body worked up a frenzy and increased endlessly in vigor.

"What's the hurry... I'm trying to tell you that you're not as smart as you think. You wanted to obtain [Black Demon Herbs] in the [Fallen God Abyss]?" Behind Jiang Xiaohan, an infinite amount of Black Demon qi was gathering unbridledly into an upside-down black ocean in the sky that seemed as if it wanted to sweep through and devour the universe. This kind of power had exceeded the range of an ordinary Immortal Step realm expert.

She looked sideways at Ye Qingyu, saying, "You mustn't have thought that you're just like the marionette you gave me when we were young. I've been keeping an eye on your journey all this time, and even the [Fallen God Abyss] map is something I lent to the Black Armor Race and instructed them to give you so as to lead you down here, where we can settle our mutual resentment and put an end to everything."

"Mutual resentment?" Ye Qingyu laughed. "You really think highly of yourself."

In actual fact, he was somewhat astonished at heart.

He had never thought that his journey in the [Fallen God Abyss] was a trap. If Jiang Xiaohan could manipulate the Black Demon qi, she could naturally get in touch with the Black Armor Race and make them do her a service. It now seemed to him that his earlier movements had been calculated by this woman. Compared to their last meeting, her growth was easily noticeable.

"Feels terrible to be figured out, eh?" Jiang Xiaohan continued to look sideways at Ye Qingyu as if she was mocking a beast that had fallen into her trap.

However, Ye Qingyu's response was...

Boom!

He abruptly catapulted into the air and drew a bolt of purple lightning in the void. Smashing a fist forth, lightning struck apocalyptically in an area of several hundred meters in circumference.

He had chosen to attack directly.

All signs showed that Jiang Xioahan had planned this for a long time and harbored ill intentions, while Ye Qingyu himself had no need to waste any time here.

"Hoho, getting impatient?" Jiang Xiaohan's Black Demon qi-formed body instantly dispersed into green smoke and easily turned into a pervasive Black Demon qi, before she said in an erratic voice, "Are you thinking about going to find that sweetheart empress? Haha, you won't have a chance. Times have changed, Ye Qingyu. I shall give you three moves, after which I'll send you to your death."

Boom boom boom!

Streaks of purple lightning bombarded maniacally around and destroyed the space within several kilometers of Ye Qingyu, even causing the Black Demon qi to be cut off.

This was the first time he had used the power of lightning at full strength ever since he mastered it.

However, the Black Demon qi wavered and wandered uninterruptedly. Ye Qingyu knew full well that his move did not even touch a corner of Jiang Xiaohan's clothes.

"Hoho, is this all you've got? The power of lightning is very strong, but unfortunately, it cannot find me... I'm so disappointed." Jiang Xiaohan's deity-like voice lingered in the surroundings as if the entire [Fallen God Abyss] was filled with her will and power, making her seem omnipresent and already blended into one with the world.

Ye Qingyu descended to the ground.

"Is that so?" An arch formed at the corners of his mouth. Suddenly, his figure shrank and his lightning-circulating palm slapped on the ground as he shouted, "[Heavenly Blind Way] and [Heavenly Sound Wave]... show your f*cking selves."

Boom!

A booming noise that sounded like dull thunder was heard throughout the land.

Then, a strange power surged underground while an invisible soundwave dissipated between Heaven and earth.

As if it was a law, the power of lightning ploughed wherever the sound wave passed through.

The [Heavenly Blind Way] was an assassination method recorded in the ancient bronze book and was suitable for blind people to use. After Ye Qingyu had imparted this technique to the visually-impaired Bai Yuanxing, the latter made a breakthrough in one stroke and increased greatly in strength. And since Ye Qingyu was able to impart it to others, he was extremely adept at it for sure, except that he very rarely displayed it.

The [Heavenly Sound Wave] was one of the most exquisite mysteries of the [Heavenly Blind Way] technique. It was a sound wave that could shake and gain insight into the world, and was best at uncovering the hidden forms of enemies. With just one palm, nothing in the world could remain hidden.

"Found you!"

Ye Qingyu had indeed perceived the location of Jiang Xiaohan's actual body.

"[Breaking Thunder]... kill!"

A strong wind abruptly shot forth and locked onto Jiang Xiaohan.

Turning into lightning, Ye Qingyu instantly attacked the locked-on position.

"Huh?" Jiang Xiaohan's countenance changed slightly. "What skill is this?"

Ever since she mastered the Black Demon qi techniques and meanings, she could become invisible wherever there was Black Demon qi, and even a pinnacle Immortal Step realm expert would not be able to detect the location of her actual body. She thus never expected Ye Qingyu to so easily discover her whereabouts.

"But..." A contemptuous arch formed at the corners of her mouth.

She raised her tender hands slightly, causing the boundless Black Demon qi behind her to surge into her body. With a thrust of her palm, a black palm mark emerged from within and instantly turned into a huge black divine spirit palm that slapped toward Ye Qingyu.

The entire action seemed slow but was actually very fast. Although it was exerted later than her opponent's action, its momentum and law were able to intercept Ye Qingyu's attack.

"So what if you find out where I really am. You're doomed to fail... [Black Demon Palm of All Things]!" she shouted as her palm force burst forth.

Boom!

The terrifying powers collided in midair, radiating waves that swept through the [Fallen God Abyss].

Ye Qingyu flew backward.

"How could it... be this strong?" He looked shocked.

He had felt a magnificent and irresistible power from Jiang Xiaohan's understated palm attack, and was beginning to feel like he could not win this fight. The power was simply too massive, firm, and continuous. It was hard for him to believe that the woman could possess such power.

Moreover, the power of the chaotic thunder liquid could not break the giant black palm.

It must be remembered that the power of lightning was a legacy of a martial emperor.

Exactly what power has Jiang Xiaohan mastered?

Ye Qingyu finally realized that he was in huge trouble. Jiang Xiaohan had become so tough that the battle would be at best a hard-fought one, and one which he had no assurance of winning.

In the sky.

With her hair fluttering crazily like black flames, Jiang Xiaohan fused into one with the boundless Black Demon qi, becoming akin to a martial goddess. Like a terrifying black hole which could distort light, her figure constantly alternated between illusion and reality, and her power changed accordingly.

"You still have two moves," her voice sounded like that of a raging demon goddess.

Ye Qingyu inhaled a deep breath.

He did not rush to strike again. While operating the nameless breathing technique, both the powers of lightning and ice appeared and covered all over his body as purple and silver flares. An invisible energy immediately diffused as his figure gradually floated up such that he was directly facing Jiang Xiaohan from afar. The howl of the ice dragon and mad cry of the purple lightning emerged from Ye Qingyu's arms, imitating the yin-yang balance in an ingenious and unusual way.

The powers of the [Supreme Ice Flame] and the chaotic thunder liquid were activated at the same time.

This was the greatest battle strength Ye Qingyu had ever exerted.

The two kinds of power were the most frightening ones he had mastered. Both contained laws and were not merely physical offensive powers, but instead had reached the level of Great Dao powers.

"Hoho, you've been saving a lot... Unfortunately, it's still too weak." Jiang Xiaohan revealed an expression of shock.

Ye Qingyu's true power had astounded her and was clearly more frightening than she had expected. She recalled how she had to pay such a huge price, go through so much suffering, and give up nearly everything in order to attain her present strength. The man in front of her instead seemed to be blessed and had gained glory in a plain sailing fashion, yet was almost as strong as her. A chilly defiance grew in her heart.
