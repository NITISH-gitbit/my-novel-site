Chapter 817:


Chapter 834, Return kindness with ingratitude
On the main seat in the main hall, Empress Yu Xiaoxing was patiently receiving the five visitors of a foreign race.
Although Yu Xiaoxing had heard their manner of speaking and questioning tone before, but as the Empress of Heaven Wasteland Domain, she still acted very tolerant and kind.
On the other side stood Old Fish, who disliked getting involved in trifles such as receiving guests and discussing official business, but was somehow standing in the corner of the hall.
He had a strange look and curiosity in his eyes, as though he was studying the guests of the Dragon-Human clan.
Seeing Ye Qingyu come in, Yu Xiaoxing revealed a faint smile, and then introduced the two parties, “Everybody, this is Palace Lord Ye. Palace Lord Ye, these are guests from the Dragon-Human clan, who have been waiting for a while.”
Upon hearing this, the several experts of the Dragon-Human clan immediately cast their eyes over with a hint of curiosity. They were all sizing up the youngster at the door, whose robe was whiter than snow, black hair like waterfall, and had an aura of elegance.
“You... are Ye Qingyu?” The Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan looked Ye Qingyu from head to toe with an arrogant expression, and did not conceal her disdain in the slightest. “My clan's most valuable treasure - the [Dragon Blood Halberd] is in your hands? Hand it over quickly!"
Ye Qingyu knitted his brows in a frown again.
Before he could respond, there was a sneer from Old Fish on the other side of the hall.
“Hey, now the juniors of the Water Race are really more and more disrespectful. Your clan's valuable treasure had been lost in the 18th district for tens of thousands of years and you had no ability to get it back. Little Ye brought it out for you and you didn't even thank him...”
“Humph, weigh yourself first before you meddle in other people's business. Old man, it's not your turn to talk. You're so old that almost all your teeth have fallen out. Hurry up and get lost!” The Third Princess shot a glance at Old Fish and interrupted him, her tone full of ridicule and mockery.
Old Fish flew into a rage upon hearing the remark, even the hair of his beard stood up on its end.
He was after all an overlord of the Water Race and had lived for millions of years, even if he was no longer powerful due to his Dao injury, ever since coming out of the Underground Moon Immortal Palace, there was no one that dared to mock him and speak to him with such an attitude.
The old ancestor of the Water Race was about to retaliate.
But Ye Qingyu gently shook his head and signaled him to stop.
The Dragon-Human clan experts were not any good people, but it was a critical moment for the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps, and it was not worth making enemies just because of a little quarrel.
Immediately, he chanted an ancient word, retrieving the [Dragon Blood Halberd] from the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
The beautifully styled and peculiar-looking halberd laid in Ye Qingyu's hand. The body of the halberd was black, about five meters long, and a lifelike golden dragon was coiling around it. The dragon scales were glowing a golden light, and the dragon head was roaring to the sky. The three prongs of the blood-red halberd extended out from the dragon head and there seemed to be essence and blood constantly transforming and condensing within them.
A strange aura that was enough to make Heaven and earth shudder instantly filled the air.
In the middle of the hall.
The gaze of the Third Princess, as well as the four experts was fixed on the halberd almost instantaneously.
A few moments later, everybody grew a little excited, eyes filled with the look of greed.
In excitement, the Third Princess turned to look at the thick-browed old man, who had a sinister glint in his eyes.
The equally excited old man nodded quickly. His eyes were still wandering around the halberd, as though he had found a valuable treasure on a pilgrimage.
Having received a positive response, the Third Princess's eyes were more overflowing with joy. She stretched out her hand and tried to grab the [Dragon Blood Halberd].
Just as her hand was about to touch the halberd, Ye Qingyu's hand flashed, causing the Third Princess to grab empty air.
The [Dragon Blood Halberd] was still firmly in the hands of Ye Qingyu.
“What? You want to steal it?”
The anger of the Third Princess was ignited in an instant, and her battle intent rapidly soared.
The four Dragon-Human clan experts beside her also glared at Ye Qingyu with hostility.
“Of course not.” Ye Qingyu's expression was cold and indifferent, “But I must make some things clear first. “I can return the [Dragon Blood Halberd] to you, but from now on, I have nothing to do with the Dragon-Human clan, and you cannot come bother me again...”
The Third Princess impatiently interrupted Ye Qingyu when she heard this, “Regarding this, you don't have to worry. Although I have heard a lot about the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland Domain during this period, but our Dragon-Human clan still attaches no importance to you.”
Indeed, the Dragon-Human clan had a well-respected status in the great wide world. They were the descendants of the ancient divine Dragon clan and the Human Race. In particularly, those of royal lineage had more or less inherited the incomparably pure dragon blood.
However, no matter how prestigious her status was, how could she be so arrogant and disrespectful, and her words were full of contempt for the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland Domain. Her hostility made Ye Qingyu feel that they came with bad intentions and didn’t want to associate with them.
In that moment, appearing in his mind was another purple-clothed girl, whose eyes were as clear as spring water under the Phoenix mask.
They both descended from a mythological animal of the ancient God and Devil Age, but the difference between the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and the Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan was simply like the difference between cloud and mud.
At this moment, Ye Qingyu's eyes flashed as he came to a decision.
“In that case, sign a document that indicates you’ve taken away the halberd.”
It was understandable to return the [Dragon Blood Halberd] to its rightful owner, and it could even be said to be a joyous matter, but the attitude that these experts of the Dragon-Human clan showed made Ye Qingyu think that he must be cautious and make them leave behind proof just in case.
“You don't trust me?” The Third Princess all of a sudden put on a solemn face, frowning.
Ye Qingyu was still indifferent and calm as before, “Of course not, this halberd is originally a sacred item of the Dragon-Human clan. I have confirmed your identity, so it's only right to return it to you, but the Dragon-Human clan is huge, with a large number of people. What if another prince or powerful person of the clan comes to find me after you left? Where will I find another [Dragon Blood Halberd] for them?”
“Humph, the mind of a person of low social status!” The Third Princess grunted coldly, looking at Ye Qingyu with an even more contemptuous expression.
Ye Qingyu flipped his hand over, and a jade greed bamboo strip appeared out of nowhere, which had already recorded down in detail the fact that the Third Princess had already taken away the [Dragon Blood Halberd].
“As long as Third Princess sign this, then you can take away the [Dragon Blood Halberd].”
The Third Princess glanced at the jade bamboo strip, and then back at the [Dragon Blood Halberd] with incredible excitement. She seemed hesitant, but after a few moments, finally injected dragon qi into the jade bamboo strip.
With this evidence, whether or not the people of the Dragon-Human clan came to the door to ask for the halberd in the future, Ye Qingyu believed that it would prevent a lot of unnecessary trouble, and even conflict.
Ye Qingyu put away the jade bamboo strip.
At the same time, the [Dragon Blood Halberd] was returned to the Third Princess.
The Third Princess had completely put aside the fury and entanglement that she had before.
She held the halberd, long fingers incessantly stroking the dragon whiskers on the halberd, feeling the majestic and familiar aura exuding from the halberd, and was overjoyed.
The other three experts of the Dragon-Human clan also showed a look of joy.
Only the previous old expert, who had had been silent all this time, was looking at Ye Qingyu with a sinister expression, saying, “Hey, Ye Qingyu, do you have anything else related to our Dragon-Human clan that you have forgotten to hand over?”
Ye Qingyu was taken aback for a moment, then a cold expression flickered in the bottom of his eye, “What do you mean by that?”
The old man, who had white eyebrows, as though he did not believe him continued to pester him, “What do you mean by that? Haha, what I mean is very simple. It is rumoured that you, Ye Qingyu, has received a lot of treasures in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. It is hard to believe that you only got the halberd. Back then, when my ancestor died in the 18th district, he did not just lose a [Dragon Blood Halberd]. My Dragon-Human clan also had another ancestral weapon - the [Dragon Scale Armour]... Since you have the [Dragon Blood Halberd], then the scale armour should naturally also be in your hands. I suggest that you quickly hand it over.”
“I only have the halberd, and not the scale armour.” Ye Qingyu narrowed his eyes.
“Oh, an honest man doesn't do anything underhanded. The person with the surname Ye, do you want to swallow the treasure of my Dragon-Human clan?” The old man laughed sinisterly.
The people of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps all immediately had a change of expression.
Anger was surging in Yu Xiaoxing's eyes.
“Lord Ye has said no, your Dragon-Human clan is simply unreasonable... Old man, do you want to falsely accuse Lord Ye?” Luo Yi couldn't help berating the old man.
“Little thing, you have no place to talk here.” The old man's face darkened. His eyes under the long brows were twinkling with a sinister and gloomy light.
But the eyes of the other four experts were fixed on Ye Qingyu, seemingly unwilling to leave the matter at that.
“That's right, Ye Qingyu, as long as you hand over my clan's treasure, I will forgive you once, and will not blame you for trying to swallow the treasures of my clan. If not...” At this point, the [Dragon Blood Halberd] in the hands of the Third Princess was trembling slightly, and the halberd light pointed directly at Ye Qingyu. Her tone was piercing, and there was a sinister smile on her face.
Ye Qingyu's expression grew icy-cold.
“The so-called Dragon-Human clan is nothing more than this. I will give you ten seconds to get out of the Green Xuan Hall, otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite.” Ye Qingyu warned, pinching the key token, which controlled the black bronze puppet figures.
The Third Princess burst into wild laughter, “I have the [Dragon Blood Halberd] in my hand, do you think I would be afraid of you? Ye Qingyu, you are just asking for death...”
Before her voice faded away.
There was a sudden change.
An ancient and terrifying power of the true dragon gushed out from the [Dragon Blood Halberd] in the direction of the Third Princess like a beast pouncing on its prey.
“Ah! What...”
Unguarded, the Third Princess was sent flying dozens of meters away, slamming into the wall of the main hall.
Boom!
A loud bang broke out in the reception hall.
The walls, inlaid with glazed ceramic patterns, were instantly cracked.
All of the people present were in utter and incomparable shock.

========================================

Chapter 818:


Chapter 835, Is that so? Then let's wait and see
All of a sudden, everyone in the hall was dumbfounded.
What was this all about?
Why did the [Dragon Blood Halberd] erupt out such a terrifying force all of a sudden, and directly struck the Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan? Logically speaking, as a descendant of the Dragon-Human clan, the Third Princess should have had an extremely high status and able to obtain the recognition of the [Dragon Blood Halberd].
Ye Qingyu was just as surprised.
The power that gushed out from the [Dragon Blood Halberd] was extremely terrifying and powerful, striking the unguarded Third Princess. If it were not for the protection of the blood-red dragon scale armour, all her bones might have been broken.
Buzz Buzz Buzz.
The [Dragon Blood Halberd] broke away from the grasp of the Third Princess and floated in the Void, slightly vibrating.
Layers upon layers of blood-red flames spread out from the halberd, and red light waves that were visible to the naked eye continued to shoot out in all directions. It was as though there was some sort of power within the [Dragon Blood Halberd] being awakened, and as if there was an ancient will about to explode; it was extremely bizarre.
“What's going on?”
The Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan roared out in disbelief, blood trickling down the corners of her mouth.
“Quick, grab the halberd first.” The cunning old man of the Dragon-Human clan was the first to react. With a loud roar, his body flashed like lightning, and jerked towards the [Dragon Blood Halberd] that was suspended in midair. The several other experts also responded upon hearing this, immediately flashing over to the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. All of them were activating yuan qi unique to the Dragon-Human clan in an attempt to control the [Dragon Blood Halberd].
But——
Boom!
Another burst of tyrannical power erupted.
All the Dragon-Human experts who charged over, before they could react, were directly propelled away by the tremendous force. Their mouths overflowed with blood, spurting out arrows of blood, and had evidently sustained quite severe injuries. They slammed back to the ground with a thud, and stumbled back several steps, with a look of shocked disbelief across their faces.
“Why? Why did the treasure of my clan rebel against us?”
“According to the records of the clan, one only need dragon blood qi to control the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. It is a unique treasure of the Dragon-Human clan, and has protected my Dragon-Human clan for countless years. Now... how would this happen?”
“Could this halberd be a fake?”
“No, impossible, whether it is the shape or aura, it is the same as what is recorded. It definitely is not a fake. It is impossible for outsiders to replicate the halberd... But, why did that happen? No, it shouldn't be.” The old man's chest was heaving up and down violently, as he panted heavily. Looking at the [Dragon Blood Halberd], which was suspended in midair dozens of meters away, he could not understand why such a thing would happen.
And at that moment, with the halberd as the center, a strange aura was spreading to the surroundings, forming a surging protective circle. The experts of the Dragon-Human clan had repeatedly tried, but in the end simply could not get close to the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. That kind of powerful and vast force was simply not something that they could resist and invade with their ability.
In the distance.
Why did the power of the
[Dragon Blood Halberd]
erupt all of a sudden?
Huh?
What was going on here?
Ye Qingyu stared in puzzlement at the halberd, which had formed a self-protective state.
Logically speaking, the [Dragon Blood Halberd], which had a spiritual nature, should only recognize the descendants of the Dragon-Human clan, and Ye Qingyu had confirmed that these people were indeed descendants of the Dragon-Human clan and not impostors——The faint dragon aura emitting from their body and the martial skills unique to the Dragon-Human clan could not be imitated by outsiders.
This was interesting.
At this moment, nobody could understand what was going on.
It was also at this very moment that a surprising change happened again.
Buzz Buzz Buzz.
The halberd that was surrounded by people of the Dragon-Human clan suddenly and violently shook. The surrounding space began to twist and distort. Everything blurred in front and then the [Dragon Blood Halberd] seemed to have sensed something, transformed into a ray of black and gold light and sped to where Ye Qingyu was, landing on his hand.
“It's...”
Ye Qingyu was stunned.
He instinctively grasped the [Dragon Blood Halberd]d.
Traces of mysterious and warm aura, like strands of silk and ripples of water, flowed out from his palm. Although it was not considered intimate, it seemed to be a form of recognition and respect.
Ye Qingyu also understood something.
The [Dragon Blood Halberd] did not acknowledge the Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan.
“Haha, hahahaha, this is too interesting, ahahaha, I'm dying from laughter. Little girl, it seems that the [Dragon Blood Halberd] does not like you, ahahaha. I know, it must be because your strength is too weak, and your personality is too bad. Haha, this halberd is indeed worthy of being called a treasure of the Dragon-Human clan. It has a spiritual nature. It knows that you guys are scum and don't deserve it at all, so it does not want to leave with you.” Old Fish, who was watching everything from the side, burst into laughter with a gloating expression on his face.
This old man would always seek revenge for the smallest grievance. The Third Princess had mocked him before, how would he let go of such an opportunity to ridicule the Third Princess.
“Nonsense.” The Third Princess was both shocked and enraged.
The old man’s face was so dark and gloomy that water was soon dripping out. He fixed a piercing stare at Ye Qingyu and spoke in a hoarse voice, “Madman Ye, you are messing with us? Is that right? How dare you, you dare to plant such a formation around the treasure of my clan, preventing it from returning to the Dragon-Human clan. Good, very good, you want to start a war with the Dragon-Human clan, is that right?”
All of the people of the Dragon-Human clan flew into a rage out of humiliation.
All of a sudden, the Third Princess and the four experts beside her, one after another, revealed expressions of fury and embarrassment, released their battle intent, and wanted to snatch the halberd back.
“Ye Qingyu, you dare to snatch a sacred item of my Dragon-Human clan!”
“Hand it over!”
“Scumbag, what evil technique did you use to control the [Dragon Blood Halberd]!”
The atmosphere suddenly turned hostile.
Empress Yu Xiaoxing was also enraged when she saw this scene.
She secretly issued an order, and soon experts of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps were quietly gathered around the hall. Ever since leaving Heaven Wasteland Domain, they had experienced countless ups and downs along the way. The Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had built up enough self-confidence and dignity, that they would never let outsiders humiliate and falsely accuse them.
Now, with an order from Ye Qingyu, even if it was to climb a mountain of swords or plunge into a sea of flames, the people of Heaven Wasteland Domain would not have the slightest hesitation.
And Ye Qingyu, who was watched by countless eyes, still had not reacted to the accusations made by the Third Princess and the others of the Dragon-Human clan.
He looked down at the [Dragon Blood Halberd], gently stroking it with the palm of his hand with a deeply moved expression on his face. He let out a sigh, and finally put away the [Dragon Blood Halberd] directly into the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
The Third Princess and the others were infuriated when they saw this scene.
“You... how dare you really swallow the treasure of my clan, you... do you want to fight against my Dragon Blood Imperial Court?” The Third Princess fumed. The duck in her hand had got away, and her plot and effort had gone to waste. She was so mad that she almost vomited blood.
“Haha, the old monster is right, you do not deserve to take away the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. The halberd has a spirit nature, and does not acknowledge scum like you. Go back, tell someone of the Dragon-Human clan who truly has virtue and status to come and see if the [Dragon Blood Halberd] is willing to return to the Dragon Blood Imperial Court,” Ye Qingyu said indifferently as before.
“What? What do you mean?” The expression on the Third Princess's face had changed greatly.
The face of the old man of the Dragon-Human clan was also twisted with impatience and anger, “Boy, I advise you to not make a mistake... Obediently hand over the [Dragon Blood Halberd], otherwise, there will be a bloodbath in Heaven Wasteland Domain, and it will be erased from the world.”
“Is that so? Then let's wait and see.” Ye Qingyu did not want to say anything more to the experts of the Dragon-Human clan. “Leave the Green Xuan Hall within ten seconds, otherwise don't blame me for being impolite. This is the encampment of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic  corps, even if a ruckus is made and the Alliance Council is notified, the one at fault would not be my Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. Hehe, what? Do you want to try?”
With that, Ye Qingyu brought out the defensive token and injected a hint of yuan qi into it.
The formation markings on the token began to heat up, and then several thin rays of gold light, like strands of hair, shot out in all directions.
The next moment, in the square in front of Green Xuan Hall.
Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!
Six black bronze statues were suddenly awakened from deep slumber, and under the guidance of Ye Qingyu, turned into streams of light, arriving at the door of the reception hall. Their thick body was as gentle as a feather, but their oppressive force was as great as being crushed by an immemorial mountain.
An aura and pressure that were close to that of a Saint expert instantly shrouded the entire reception hall.
“Not good, this... it's the black gold battle puppets! The Human Race has actually given this sort of thing to the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps?” The sinister looking, white-browed old man trembled with a face full of shock, and a trace of fear seemed to be passing across his eyes.
“What? The black gold battle puppets? The legendary divine guards of the Human Race? How can it be? Didn’t they say that only Ren Puyang has it? This...” The Third Princess and the other experts turned ashen upon hearing these words.
Others may not know about the power of the black gold battle puppets, but they did.
It was a valuable treasure handed down from the era of the Human Race Formation Emperor Luosu. It could be described as a true killing machine. It was unknown how many foreign race experts had fallen under the blades of the metal army. Across the whole world, anybody who understood the power would be deterred by the terrifying puppets.
The Third Princess had an unwilling look on her face, but as her eyes swept over the black bronze puppets, her greed in the end was defeated by her fear.
“Humph! You have taken the sacred item of my clan and now want to silence us? Ye Qingyu, you will be sorry!”
The Third Princess glowered at him, her aura piercing cold. Although unwilling to leave, she was also aware of the current situation. At this moment she had no choice but to put away the tough talk, and go back to give the matter further thought.
Chapter 835, Is that so? Then let's wait and see

All of a sudden, everyone in the hall was dumbfounded.
What was this all about?
Why did the [Dragon Blood Halberd] erupt out such a terrifying force all of a sudden, and directly struck the Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan? Logically speaking, as a descendant of the Dragon-Human clan, the Third Princess should have had an extremely high status and able to obtain the recognition of the [Dragon Blood Halberd].
Ye Qingyu was just as surprised.
The power that gushed out from the [Dragon Blood Halberd] was extremely terrifying and powerful, striking the unguarded Third Princess. If it were not for the protection of the blood-red dragon scale armour, all her bones might have been broken.
Buzz Buzz Buzz.
The [Dragon Blood Halberd] broke away from the grasp of the Third Princess and floated in the Void, slightly vibrating.
Layers upon layers of blood-red flames spread out from the halberd, and red light waves that were visible to the naked eye continued to shoot out in all directions. It was as though there was some sort of power within the [Dragon Blood Halberd] being awakened, and as if there was an ancient will about to explode; it was extremely bizarre.
“What's going on?”
The Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan roared out in disbelief, blood trickling down the corners of her mouth.
“Quick, grab the halberd first.” The cunning old man of the Dragon-Human clan was the first to react. With a loud roar, his body flashed like lightning, and jerked towards the [Dragon Blood Halberd] that was suspended in midair. The several other experts also responded upon hearing this, immediately flashing over to the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. All of them were activating yuan qi unique to the Dragon-Human clan in an attempt to control the [Dragon Blood Halberd].
But——
Boom!
Another burst of tyrannical power erupted.
All the Dragon-Human experts who charged over, before they could react, were directly propelled away by the tremendous force. Their mouths overflowed with blood, spurting out arrows of blood, and had evidently sustained quite severe injuries. They slammed back to the ground with a thud, and stumbled back several steps, with a look of shocked disbelief across their faces.
“Why? Why did the treasure of my clan rebel against us?”
“According to the records of the clan, one only need dragon blood qi to control the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. It is a unique treasure of the Dragon-Human clan, and has protected my Dragon-Human clan for countless years. Now... how would this happen?”
“Could this halberd be a fake?”
“No, impossible, whether it is the shape or aura, it is the same as what is recorded. It definitely is not a fake. It is impossible for outsiders to replicate the halberd... But, why did that happen? No, it shouldn't be.” The old man's chest was heaving up and down violently, as he panted heavily. Looking at the [Dragon Blood Halberd], which was suspended in midair dozens of meters away, he could not understand why such a thing would happen.
And at that moment, with the halberd as the center, a strange aura was spreading to the surroundings, forming a surging protective circle. The experts of the Dragon-Human clan had repeatedly tried, but in the end simply could not get close to the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. That kind of powerful and vast force was simply not something that they could resist and invade with their ability.
In the distance.
Why did the power of the
[Dragon Blood Halberd]
erupt all of a sudden?
Huh?
What was going on here?
Ye Qingyu stared in puzzlement at the halberd, which had formed a self-protective state.
Logically speaking, the [Dragon Blood Halberd], which had a spiritual nature, should only recognize the descendants of the Dragon-Human clan, and Ye Qingyu had confirmed that these people were indeed descendants of the Dragon-Human clan and not impostors——The faint dragon aura emitting from their body and the martial skills unique to the Dragon-Human clan could not be imitated by outsiders.
This was interesting.
At this moment, nobody could understand what was going on.
It was also at this very moment that a surprising change happened again.
Buzz Buzz Buzz.
The halberd that was surrounded by people of the Dragon-Human clan suddenly and violently shook. The surrounding space began to twist and distort. Everything blurred in front and then the [Dragon Blood Halberd] seemed to have sensed something, transformed into a ray of black and gold light and sped to where Ye Qingyu was, landing on his hand.
“It's...”
Ye Qingyu was stunned.
He instinctively grasped the [Dragon Blood Halberd]d.
Traces of mysterious and warm aura, like strands of silk and ripples of water, flowed out from his palm. Although it was not considered intimate, it seemed to be a form of recognition and respect.
Ye Qingyu also understood something.
The [Dragon Blood Halberd] did not acknowledge the Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan.
“Haha, hahahaha, this is too interesting, ahahaha, I'm dying from laughter. Little girl, it seems that the [Dragon Blood Halberd] does not like you, ahahaha. I know, it must be because your strength is too weak, and your personality is too bad. Haha, this halberd is indeed worthy of being called a treasure of the Dragon-Human clan. It has a spiritual nature. It knows that you guys are scum and don't deserve it at all, so it does not want to leave with you.” Old Fish, who was watching everything from the side, burst into laughter with a gloating expression on his face.
This old man would always seek revenge for the smallest grievance. The Third Princess had mocked him before, how would he let go of such an opportunity to ridicule the Third Princess.
“Nonsense.” The Third Princess was both shocked and enraged.
The old man’s face was so dark and gloomy that water was soon dripping out. He fixed a piercing stare at Ye Qingyu and spoke in a hoarse voice, “Madman Ye, you are messing with us? Is that right? How dare you, you dare to plant such a formation around the treasure of my clan, preventing it from returning to the Dragon-Human clan. Good, very good, you want to start a war with the Dragon-Human clan, is that right?”
All of the people of the Dragon-Human clan flew into a rage out of humiliation.
All of a sudden, the Third Princess and the four experts beside her, one after another, revealed expressions of fury and embarrassment, released their battle intent, and wanted to snatch the halberd back.
“Ye Qingyu, you dare to snatch a sacred item of my Dragon-Human clan!”
“Hand it over!”
“Scumbag, what evil technique did you use to control the [Dragon Blood Halberd]!”
The atmosphere suddenly turned hostile.
Empress Yu Xiaoxing was also enraged when she saw this scene.
She secretly issued an order, and soon experts of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps were quietly gathered around the hall. Ever since leaving Heaven Wasteland Domain, they had experienced countless ups and downs along the way. The Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had built up enough self-confidence and dignity, that they would never let outsiders humiliate and falsely accuse them.
Now, with an order from Ye Qingyu, even if it was to climb a mountain of swords or plunge into a sea of flames, the people of Heaven Wasteland Domain would not have the slightest hesitation.
And Ye Qingyu, who was watched by countless eyes, still had not reacted to the accusations made by the Third Princess and the others of the Dragon-Human clan.
He looked down at the [Dragon Blood Halberd], gently stroking it with the palm of his hand with a deeply moved expression on his face. He let out a sigh, and finally put away the [Dragon Blood Halberd] directly into the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
The Third Princess and the others were infuriated when they saw this scene.
“You... how dare you really swallow the treasure of my clan, you... do you want to fight against my Dragon Blood Imperial Court?” The Third Princess fumed. The duck in her hand had got away, and her plot and effort had gone to waste. She was so mad that she almost vomited blood.
“Haha, the old monster is right, you do not deserve to take away the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. The halberd has a spirit nature, and does not acknowledge scum like you. Go back, tell someone of the Dragon-Human clan who truly has virtue and status to come and see if the [Dragon Blood Halberd] is willing to return to the Dragon Blood Imperial Court,” Ye Qingyu said indifferently as before.
“What? What do you mean?” The expression on the Third Princess's face had changed greatly.
The face of the old man of the Dragon-Human clan was also twisted with impatience and anger, “Boy, I advise you to not make a mistake... Obediently hand over the [Dragon Blood Halberd], otherwise, there will be a bloodbath in Heaven Wasteland Domain, and it will be erased from the world.”
“Is that so? Then let's wait and see.” Ye Qingyu did not want to say anything more to the experts of the Dragon-Human clan. “Leave the Green Xuan Hall within ten seconds, otherwise don't blame me for being impolite. This is the encampment of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic  corps, even if a ruckus is made and the Alliance Council is notified, the one at fault would not be my Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. Hehe, what? Do you want to try?”
With that, Ye Qingyu brought out the defensive token and injected a hint of yuan qi into it.
The formation markings on the token began to heat up, and then several thin rays of gold light, like strands of hair, shot out in all directions.
The next moment, in the square in front of Green Xuan Hall.
Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!
Six black bronze statues were suddenly awakened from deep slumber, and under the guidance of Ye Qingyu, turned into streams of light, arriving at the door of the reception hall. Their thick body was as gentle as a feather, but their oppressive force was as great as being crushed by an immemorial mountain.
An aura and pressure that were close to that of a Saint expert instantly shrouded the entire reception hall.
“Not good, this... it's the black gold battle puppets! The Human Race has actually given this sort of thing to the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps?” The sinister looking, white-browed old man trembled with a face full of shock, and a trace of fear seemed to be passing across his eyes.
“What? The black gold battle puppets? The legendary divine guards of the Human Race? How can it be? Didn’t they say that only Ren Puyang has it? This...” The Third Princess and the other experts turned ashen upon hearing these words.
Others may not know about the power of the black gold battle puppets, but they did.
It was a valuable treasure handed down from the era of the Human Race Formation Emperor Luosu. It could be described as a true killing machine. It was unknown how many foreign race experts had fallen under the blades of the metal army. Across the whole world, anybody who understood the power would be deterred by the terrifying puppets.
The Third Princess had an unwilling look on her face, but as her eyes swept over the black bronze puppets, her greed in the end was defeated by her fear.
“Humph! You have taken the sacred item of my clan and now want to silence us? Ye Qingyu, you will be sorry!”
The Third Princess glowered at him, her aura piercing cold. Although unwilling to leave, she was also aware of the current situation. At this moment she had no choice but to put away the tough talk, and go back to give the matter further thought.

Chapter 819:


Chapter 836, As though had seen a ghost



“Let's go, this matter won't be left at this.”

The people of the Dragon-Human clan left behind a warning before leaving.

In the end, the Third Princess, along with the shrewd old man, left filled with unwillingness and indignation, but there was nothing they could do. The three other experts turned into streams of flowing light, leaving resentfully.

It finally quieted down in the hall.

Y
e Qingyu, with a thought, controlled the key token, letting the six black bronze battle puppets return to the square, and return into deep sleep.

“Haha, what a bunch of trash. I reckon that Third Princess secretly came to get the [Dragon Blood Halberd]d, and it was not the intention of the higher-ups of the Dragon-Human clan.” Watching the Third Princess and the others walk away in dejection, Old Fish felt better than eating a chilled watermelon during the hottest periods of summer.

“It's very likely.” Yu Xiaoxing nodded. “Cousin has used the [Dragon Blood Halberd]d in the battle a few days ago. Somebody must have recognized it, and spread it out. Who would have thought that the Third Princess would come to take it back in such an aggressive way when she heard about it... It's not that there's no leeway for the situation to turn around. There are many experts in the Dragon Blood Imperial Court, they wouldn't be so petty.”

This was considered as comforting everybody, lest the members of Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps feel pressured.

Ye Qingyu smiled, “That's right, but the Third Princess of the Dragon-Human clan is really not good enough. Even the precious treasure of her clan did not want to be used by her. It is pitiful. A person like her is nothing to be feared, but that old man of the Dragon-Human clan is cunning and shrewd. This was most likely planned by him... However, what happened today is also a good thing. The Dragon-Human clan has been alarmed, and they will come to the door for the [Dragon Blood Halberd]. This halberd in the end has to be returned to the Dragon Blood Imperial Court. I have made an oath to the martial spirit in the 18th district.”

At this point, the matter was considered as temporarily resolved.

……

Leaving the hall, Ye Qingyu again headed to the West courtyard.

Yesterday he had asked Luo Yi to take some of the divine grass and treasures he obtained from the 18th district to sell in Heaven Connect City. The large number of resources he got in exchange was given to Wang Zhen to buy medicinal herbs and medicines. The injured people in the West courtyard had better treatment, but those so-called famous doctors of Heaven Connect City...

Ye Qingyu was going there to solve this matter.

Just as he stepped into the West courtyard, he saw a dozen of Wang Zhen’s young apprentices decocting medicinal herbs. A strong herbal fragrance filled the nose. Ye Qingyu gently took a sniff, and from the smell, could distinguish the composition of the formula. He could not help but knit his brows in a frown.

“Lord Ye.”

“We pay our respects to Palace Lord Ye.”

The young apprentices were very well behaved, bowing respectfully when they saw Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu responded with a smile, and let them continue to concentrate on the decoction. He came to the central consultation hall in the center of West courtyard.

Pushing the door open, he saw Wang Zhen arguing angrily with the two famous doctors of Heaven Connect City.

The two famous doctors were both dressed in silk robes and exuded a condescending attitude. They wore a face of disdain and contempt, and evidently didn't care much about Wang Zhen's anger and argument.

Ye Qingyu walked in, and someone bowed.

It was only then when Wang Zhen noticed Ye Qingyu and came over to pay respect with an embarrassed look on his face.

“What's the matter?” Ye Qingyu looked at him.

Before Wang Zhen could say anything, one of the famous doctors of Heaven Connect City spoke, his tone filled with disdain, “I say what is the matter with you lowly people? Well? Do you want to save them? If you want the wounded people to live, then listen to our arrangement. You're an official of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps, aren't you? You came at the right time, can you tell this guy who doesn't understand medicine at all, right, right, right, this stupid thing called Wang Zhen to move aside and not question our medical skills. He's wasting time...”

“That's right, tell that stupid guy called Wang Zhen to get lost, or we'll go.” Another famous doctor also made a threat, looking at Ye Qingyu with a sneer on his face.

Wang Zhen was infuriated, but dared not to show it in front of Ye Qingyu. His facial expression continuously changed, and eventually he clenched his teeth to endure this fury and said to Ye Qingyu, “Lord, subordinate has disappointed you. Taking into consideration the overall situation, I will withdraw voluntarily. As long as the injuries of the wounded brothers will be better, it doesn't matter.”

With that, he turned and was about to leave.

How would Ye Qingyu not be able to tell how Wang Zhen was feeling at this time? He patted him on the shoulder, “The overall situation? What overall situation, you think these incompetent idiots can really cure our brothers’ injuries? You don't have to go, tell these swindling so-called famous doctors to scram.”

Wang Zhen was stunned.

“Lord, you...” He twisted around, staring at Ye Qingyu in disbelief, “You're saying...”

Y
e Qingyu smiled, “Today I can conclude that these so-called famous doctors of Heaven Connect City, him and him...” Ye Qingyu pointed to the two arrogant so-called famous doctors, and then pointed to the two who sat at the side leisurely drinking tea, “Lock those swindling guys away first, until they spit out the benefits that they have swallowed. If they do not obediently do so, then break their legs. Haha do you really think my Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps are uneducated, uncivilized fools? You dare come to the door to cheat us.”

The moment these words came out, the two famous doctors who were originally haughty and arrogant suddenly had an abrupt change of expression.

“What did you say?” The man who started it was furious, pointed to Ye Qingyu and smiled coldly, “Who are you? Well? At such a young age, how dare you say I'm a liar? Little guy, we're doctors hired by your Empress. Do you want to save people? Well?”

The other doctor also flew into a rage and snapped, “Do you know what injuries your people had sustained? Well? Don't cure them... Let's go, what attitude, I can't stand it.”

“This...” Wang Zhen was hesitant.

After a vicious battle, some people of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps were very severely wounded, and were affected by a foreign force. Even if they were barely able to survive, the foreign force could not be suppressed and their strength could not be restored. Adding to this, their life yuan and vitality were affected. For a martial artist, it was simply worse than death. Therefore, the Empress had issued an order that no matter what the cost, she hoped that the injured could fully recover.

Wang Zhen was regarded as one of the Medical Gods of Heaven Wasteland Domain, but could not fully fulfill the request of the Empress.

Although he did not understand the treatment and method that these famous doctors had used, but they really did seem to have some effect. The situation of the injured people had improved a lot. However, the famous doctors really did not have the compassion of a doctor, not only did they increase the price every now and then, they were not eager to treat the wounded people at all and only ate and drank. At most only one third of their time was spent on the treatment of the wounded people, while the rest was spent on drinking tea and resting. As a result he could not hold back but snap at these so-called famous doctors.

Although Wang Zhen was furious to be criticized by the famous doctors in front of Ye Qingyu, but on another thought, as long as he could save lives, he did not mind to suffer a little. Thus, he accepted their criticism and was about to turn away.

But Wang Zhen did not think that Ye Qingyu would identify these people as scammers and wanted to arrest them... This would vent his hatred, but if they really arrested them, then what about the injured brothers?

After some thought, Wang Zhen wanted to persuade Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu saw through the thoughts of the Medical God of Heaven Wasteland Domain with one glance, shook his head, and explained, “Leader Wang, you are thinking too much. These few people are not so-called famous doctors, you have been fooled by them. It’s only because they used many medicinal herbs and plants that do not grow in Heaven Wasteland Domain so you are unfamiliar with them. Also you haven’t read the medical scriptures of the outside world. In fact, given your medical knowledge, attainments and talent, with more contact with some of the medicines of the outside world, it would only take you one year to surpass these crooks...”

Speaking of which, Ye Qingyu looked at the furious doctors of Heaven Connect City, “I have already investigated the so-called pills that you are selling at high prices. Whether it is the Sky Dragon's Whiskers, Cold Spirit Seed, Three-Coloured Golden Silver Grass, or the Violet-Gold Dragon Ginseng, they are all poorly refined. I have watched your refining techniques, you are only at the Spirit Pill boundary. The prescription that you made the young apprentices formulate outside is nothing more than a decoction that enriches the blood and improves qi. Each one is incredibly expensive, and even if you had added something called the roots of the Spirit Xuan Yuan Grass, the decoction is still inferior to the [Rejuvenation Pill] that Wang Zhen created. It is simply a medicinal formula that wastes natural resources. Even if the root of the Spirit Xuan Yuan Grass was added, the effect is only the stimulation of vitality for a short period of time, and will not last. Instead it harms the wounded people... What? Am I right?”

The two prideful and arrogant doctors suddenly turned ashen.

The eyes of the two were as though they had seen a ghost in broad daylight.

The other two famous doctors who were sitting leisurely on the chair, spat out the tea from their mouth, jumped out like rabbits and stared at Ye Qingyu in disbelief.

When Wang Zhen heard up to here, lights burst out of his eyes all of a sudden.

As Ye Qingyu had said, his medical knowledge was profound and his talent was outstanding. It was only because he came from Heaven Wasteland Domain that his vision was limited, so he was trapped in a shackle. Upon hearing this from Ye Qingyu, he suddenly understood something. He recalled what happened these days and immediately knew that what Ye Qingyu had said was the truth. He had been deceived.

“Humph, I don't know what you're talking about. But since you don't trust us, I'm going to leave. Your Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps will have to find someone else.” One of the famous doctors flicked his sleeve, and with a look of incomparable anger, was about to leave.

========================================

Chapter 820:


Chapter 837, The real purpose (1)

“Right, let's go.”

“Not only do they not trust us, but also insulted us. We're not doing it no matter how much more resources you give us.”

The other famous doctors also had a change of expression and were about to leave.

Ye Qingyu smiled.

He did not stop them and only said indifferently, “Ten days ago, when I was in Falcon Sheep City, there were some people who did not listen to my advice and insisted on leaving the designated area. As a result they were all turned into corpses. Among them, there were five Great Saint experts of the Black Moon Immortal Palace, and a monster called the Blood Demon, sigh, and a few other great demons. I heard that they were all Saint level experts, but not even their ashes could be found...” Ye Qingyu glanced at them with a smile before he continued, “So, you really want to be like those guys, not listen to my orders and insist on leaving? Well?”

Their expression changed wildly.

They stood rooted to the spot, and could not move a single step.

“You... you are the [Ice Sword Killing God] Ye Qingyu?”

“You are the legendary Demon King Ye?”

The famous doctors of Heaven Connect City were all shivering in fear.

It was not until this moment that they realized what sort of terrifying existence this youngster was.

Regarding the deeds of Demon King Ye, they have heard too much these few days. Needless to say, it would be as easy as pinching a few chicks for the person who dared to kill the Great Saint experts of the Black Moon Immortal Palace to kill a few of them. To tell the truth, they had the courage to use this opportunity to cheat the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps because they had a lot of confidence in their method. The art of healing was not the same as a fight between martial artists, and paid particular attention to skill, technique and the essence. Moreover they had deceived many newcomers to the city using this method before, especially the diplomatic corps from other domains.

Over the past long period of time, as professional doctors with a perfect relationship with thousands of other doctors from different races, with carefully crafted tricks and lies, and with the most perfect method, they had succeeded countless times before. Despite knowing that Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps should not be provoked, they finally decided to take the risk and recommended themselves. They received the trust of the officials sent by Empress Yu Xiaoxing, and eventually, after passing a very small test, became doctors hired by the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps and the famous doctors of Heaven Connect City in the eyes of all people.

However, they had never thought that Demon King Ye could see through their deception. Could it be that he was also a Master skilled in the art of medicine?

At this moment, they realized that they might have kicked an iron plate.

No matter whom it was, in the face of Demon King Ye, who rose to fame on the Road of Chaos, they wouldn't have the slightest bit of luck.

“Sir... Sir, we... didn't... didn't mean to offend you.” The doctor who was the most arrogant and domineering at the start, was shivering like a frightened lamb, “We didn't know that you... you are also a master in medicine. Please forgive us, we are willing to return all of the money and resources...”

“Yes, yes, we were wrong, we admit our mistake.”

After all, they were not martial artists who would fight to death. There were people from all trades in Heaven Connect City, and they belonged to those who would never risk their lives. At this moment, they were terrified by Ye Qingyu’s power and prestige, trembling all over. They admitted their mistakes right away, which was one thing that they have learnt from the experiences in the past. Once found, immediately accept punishment. This would be better than losing your life.

Moreover, as residents of Heaven Connect City, their life was very precious and the average person would not dare to kill them.

“Admit mistake?” Ye Qingyu smiled. “You delayed the healing of my brothers, but also stimulated their origin source and vitality using the roots of the irritant herb Spirit Xuan Yuan Grass. If I let you get out of here alive, then I will let my many brothers down.”

As Ye Qingyu was speaking, a dense and seemingly solid blood fiend aura spread out from his body.

This was the murderous qi that he had accumulated throughout his countless bloody massacres and his escapes from the edge of a mountain of blades and sea of flames. Ordinary experts would lose their courage and will to fight if they were attacked by such murderous qi.

The famous doctors were so terrified that they went weak and fell on their knees.

“No, no, no, Lord, forgive us.”

“You can't kill us, we're residents of Heaven Connect City, we're registered citizens.”

“Yes Yes, Lord, forgive us, we are willing to pay any price.”

They frantically begged for mercy.

Ye Qingyu swept his gaze across, and asked in an indifferent tone of voice, “Really? Are you willing to pay any price?”

……

After one hour.

Ye Qingyu walked out of the main consultation hall.

The famous doctors, who were scared out of their wits, had now become slaves to the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps——at least until the wounded people had fully recovered. They had to follow Wang Zhen around without complaint to treat the injured. At this time they had completely put away their arrogance, trembling in fear, worried that they would anger Ye Qingyu, while Wang Zhen had become their direct commander.

From the beginning Ye Qingyu did not have the intention to kill them.

Ye Qingyu already knew that there was a problem with them from the moment he saw them a few days ago.

But at that time he did not expose them. That day he took the medicine that the famous doctors sold to the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps at a high price to the [Cloud Top Cauldron] for investigation. After a careful analysis, Ye Qingyu understood everything. What he had done today was to frighten the famous doctors of Heaven Connect City, making them voluntarily work for the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.

Although they were scammers, they were still doctors after all, and since they were registered in the Heaven Connect City, then they must have some skills and should be much better than the young apprentices. Moreover they were familiar with many medical scriptures in the world, and had the knowledge of the medicinal properties of various herbs. They should be able to help Wang Zhen.
