Chapter 361:


362 - Gluttons

As the largest city of Heaven Wasteland Domain, the wealth and glory of the Snow Capital had far exceeded everyone's imagination.

That day, Dugu Quan, that misbehaving old man, had told Lin Baiyi to bring Ye Qingyu to experience the nightlife of Snow Capital. He had winked at Ye Qingyu, but Ye Qingyu did not pay much attention to it. Tonight, as he followed the other young experts out, this was namely the time when the lights were beginning to be lit. They sat on the flying carriage provided by the military headquarters, and it was like flying in amongst the stars. It made one completely amazed by this dazzling sight.

Of the crowd, only the youth that was titled [Heaven's Clouds] originated from Snow Capital, and came from the army that reported to the capital. He was somewhat more familiar than the others about the capital, and it was him who led the way. The first place they chose was a famous restaurant. Through the special connection between it and the army, they forcefully managed to obtain two tables of the hall of the restaurant.

The flying carriage very quickly arrived at the restaurant called the [Resting Heavenly Immortal], and stopped in front of it.

The youth all left the carriage, every one of them singing praises.

"Heaven's, this is even more awe inspiring than the commander's residence of the North East army."

"This is my first time seeing such a glorious restaurant. It is like a palace."

"Can this really be a restaurant? Could we have taken a wrong turn somewhere?"

The young experts were all surprised, exclaiming out loud.

On the battlefield, they were killing gods like the Asura, killing demons and slaughtering devils. They were little war gods that countless comrades trusted and relied on the most. Within the army, they were idols that every soldier admired. They were representatives of authority, strength and courage. But here, they were like a crowd of innocent children. They were all comrades of similar background. After experiencing a month of closed isolation training, everyone was familiar with each other through constant clashes. They lowered all their defences and pretense, laughing, with arms around each others shoulders, unbridled laughter resounding.

It was hard for anyone to believe that the average strength of this group of young experts already neared the Bitter Sea stage.

Ye Qingyu was also influenced by such an atmosphere, and was completely immersed amongst the youths.

"That's right, we came from a bitter place that underwent war and fire. How could we have experienced such a degree of luxury." Seeing those noble and wealthy people entering and leaving the restaurant with brocaded silk outfits, Ye Qingyu could not help but feel somewhat emotional. "The reason we are able to reach such a stage is because we took such a path step by step. We forged our own way, sword stroke after sword stroke. Luxury is good, but do not be enraptured by this to prevent your martial path from going astray and your martial heart from being covered by dust."

As these words were said, the expressions of the young experts became serious.

If it was other people who said such words, they would have mocked and laughed at it. But the authority and respect commanded by the [War God] within the group was really far too high.

"Then... why don't we switch to a more normal place?" [Avalanche] scratched the back of his head, stammering.

The gazes of everyone looked towards Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu smiled faintly. "We don't need to do that. As the saying goes, enjoy your life to the fullest. Only when you act according to your will can your martial path be clear. The pleasures of the mortal world passes through our eyes, but the martial will is within our heart. As long as we maintain our heart, what are we afraid of. The temptations of fame and glory, perhaps it can even make our martial heart more determined."

Everyone nodded their head in deep thought.

"Haha, then what are we waiting for. Let's rush in and eat a good meal first. Wahaha, my saliva is already dripping." [Avalanche] began shouting loudly.

Everyone began cheering.

The mood of every young expert was unprecedentedly free.

"Go, go, go. We've eaten Spirit herbs and divine medicine everyday. Although it is extremely nourishing, but it's taste is really too awful. Today we must eat as we please..."

"Hahaha, are you not afraid of eating this restaurant bankrupt."

"That's right, that's right.‚Äù

The group laughingly arrived at the entrance to the restaurant.

Six beautiful young women stood at the entrance and welcomed them with charming smiles.

At this time, a piercing noise came from behind them ----

"All move aside, are you all blind? Young Master Du has come..." Accompanied by the sound of footsteps, several figures charged in and barged past the youths as they opened a path. They saw a green silk clothed youth with a wealthy face that slowly strode in. There were two guards wearing their companion swords at his two sides, their strength was around the high stages of the Spirit spring.

From the great hall of the restaurant, there were several middle-aged men that also wore similar luxurious clothing. With respect on their face, they rushed to welcome such people.

These three people should be characters like the managers of the restaurant.

From their actions, this green silk robed rich young master must have an exceptional background.

"Back away, back away, back away. Do you all not have eyes?" The guards fiercely pushed away the young experts. But they discovered they could not even near them. With an expression of rage, they unsheathed the long sword at their waist.

There was even someone who pointed at the noses of the youth with his sword. "Oh, blocking the way? Seeing your country bumpkin-like appearance, you must come from outside the city? What is it, you want to die?"

[Avalanche], who had an explosive temper, took a step forward, about to act.

Ye Qingyu pulled at him from behind, lightly shaking his head.

After this brief interaction, this scuffle attracted the attention of the richly dressed young masters.

The two guards with a severe aura, also stared at the youths. There was a light that exploded from their eyes, and a cold killing intent began to emanate from them.

The youths all had sneers on their faces. Such a level of qi had become a common sight to them. It had no way of creating any sort of threat towards them.

There was surprise on the young master with green silk clothing as he spotted the military uniform on the young experts. Waving his hand, he indicated for his subordinates to back away. Then he said something to the three managers of the restaurant, and brought the experts by his side into the restaurant.

As for the rest of the guards, they remained behind outside the entrance.

"Haha, a group of trash. If this was within the army, I would have beaten them so hard their mother would not be able to recognize them," [Avalanche] said in a low voice.

The complexion of the youths also turned unfriendly.

This group may have been young, but every one of them was a vicious character that was not restricted by rules or laws in the slightest. How could they be afraid of such young masters. It was only that this was the capital, and the water here was far too deep. Furthermore, they were of a military identity, and could not act on their temper. After experiencing so many things, they could already control themselves.

Under the direction of a little female servant, the crowd entered into the restaurant.

In an instant, a golden light filled with the sparkle of jewellery shined at them, as if they had entered into a mountain. The youths curiously evaluated their surroundings. Ye Qingyu was also shocked by the ornaments and decoration that spoke of newly minted wealth. He originally thought that such a famous restaurant would have classical interior decoration, but it did not match his expectations.

If a phrase could be used to describe the environment, it would be gold and jade in glorious splendour.

Everything seemed to have gold dust sprinkled on it. Under the shine of the formation lights, the golden reflection shined back on everything.

The interior of the restaurant seemed even larger on the inside than the outside. They should have used some sort of formation array to pass through the people on the tables. The people on these tables were either rich or wealthy. There were also waitresses wearing pale gold female outfits, that poured tea and wine, their words sweet and charming. Their white skin and shapely figure caused others to give them more than a few glances.

Under the lead of the waitress, the crowd very quickly arrived to the booked table.

This was two tables that were near the corner. It was not in too good a position, with faint darkness. There was no way to see the most central part of the hall by sitting here.

There were several gluttons in this group of youths. As soon as they sat down, they ordered the best kinds of food of the restaurant to try out. Seeing their attire, the female servant kindly reminded that the food here was expensive. But evidently this group of gluttons did not pay attention to such a reminder, the quantity of food and drink they ordered was vast.

The waitress did not dare tarry. After placing the order for drinks, she reported back to the manager of the great hall.

In a flash, a middle-aged manager with an amiable attitude and a smile came over. He brought the list of drinks and confirmed it with them, only then did he believe it. Turning around, he began to order the kitchen to prepare.

In but a short moment's time, food and wine unendingly began to be served to them.

They swapped the cups for larger containers. Although they were all martial experts and could not be made drunk, but after several cups of wine had reached their stomach, everyone loosened up. They began laughingly talking to each other. They no longer just solely used the cold and icy titles on the [Dragon Tiger List] of the training camp. It was unknown who it was who suggested it first, but [Avalanche] began giving a detailed introduction as to his background.

Ye Qingyu also gave an explanation as to who he was and where he was from.

As these introductions were said, the young experts began to feel that they had many things in common.

Because everyone discovered that, prior to entering the training camp, they had all heard of the name and battle records of these people. They were all the rising stars of the army. Although they came from different armies from all regions of the Empire, but they were dazzling military stars. The military had once intentionally used their names as promotion, or perhaps they had long heard of their names through some other channels.

"So you are the person who controlled the thirty-six experts in the South West, Han Tianshuang."

"Haha, I have also long heard of the name of the [Tyrannical Hammer]."

The conversation became even more joyous once everyone knew everyone's true identity.

"Haha, I really did not imagine [The Leaf of Youyan], Ye Qingyu, would be you, [War God]." [Flowing Light] said with a smile. "I had once thought that if we met, we must have a battle. Perhaps I would be able to defeat you and use your name to become famed throughout the Empire."

"Haha, I also had a similar thought."

"When the military began promoting [The Leaf of Youyan], I was not willing to accept this. But right now, I have completely accepted this."

The names of these young experts were restricted to within the army, and did not count for much within the Jianghu. Only Ye Qingyu, because he had crossed hands with the young leaders of the Jianghu, and had glorious battle records, was different. He could be said to have 'Shaken Jianghu'. Therefore, the fame he had within Jianghu had attracted the envy of the other young experts.

They ate their fill during this dinner.

"Delicious, it's too tasty. I've nearly bitten off my own tongue."

"Order another portion, quickly get another portion of this dish."

"Haha, this wine is not bad, I want another three jars."

The young men were really far too able to eat. Not only could they eat much, they could also eat quickly. Ultimately, the waitress was nearly made busy from the trips she had to make, and had to get further aid from tens of waitresses to run to carry the dishes. That way, they could barely satisfy the speed of eating of the youths.

Such a scene, attracted the attention of the other customers. Many people looked over.

It was really a strange sight.

Ye Qingyu could not laugh or cry and could not help remembering the scene of Wen Wan eating noodles.

But the atmosphere could be said to harmonious.

When the young men were about half full, an unexpected change occurred---

Bang!

A loud sound.

Wood went scattering everywhere. A figure was kicked down from the second floor, directly striking onto the table of the young experts‚Ä¶

========================================

Chapter 362:


363 - Qiu Fenghan

Sitting in the private room on the fifth floor, Qiu Fenghan carefully suppressed the rage in her heart.

As one of the four main requisitioning officers of the back lines of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] of the North East army of the Empire, she was one of the only female officers of the four main armies of requisitioning officers.

Within the army, Qiu Fenghan was given the complement of [The Flower of the Thunder Army].

Ever since she entered along with her father to the army of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity], Qiu Fenghan had never left the battle until four years ago when her father had died in battle. Two years ago, she had accumulated enough military merits and had been given the role of requisitioning officer in the backlines of the army. She had handled a great quantity of resources as well as wages, and had many great merits with the [Whip of the Thunder Deity].

In the past ten years, this beautiful, powerful, heroic and courageous female expert had always been the most beautiful goddess in the hearts of the soldiers of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity].

This time, she had travelled a million miles to come to Snow Capital for an important duty. She had come here to obtain much needed formation metal and stone to combat against the North East offence of the Brute Race.

Originally, everything had been agreed. The commander had already received the reply from the military headquarters. She had only came here to follow the rules and carry the resources to the frontlines of the North East.

But who knew that after she reported to the military department, she was delayed by an unexpected tribulation.

The resources that they originally needed was temporarily frozen.

Qiu Fenghan was forced to remain for two months within Snow Capital.

For this beautiful and valiant female, this was the first time she discovered that the situation within Snow Capital would be so complex. To think that some of the noble families and powerful would be as daring and as impudent as they were. Their craziness was evident that they would even dare detain an authorized military resource authorized by the Imperial family.

She had been within the Snow Capital for two months and had faintly realized that it was people of the Du household who had detained the military resource.

After several investigations, the opposing party did not say the reason why they were not willing to hand over the resource.

As reports came from the frontlines that grew increasingly urgent, that came day after day like snowflakes into the hands of Qiu Fenghan, this strong female expert was about to be driven crazy.

Finally, today she had managed to arrange a meeting between the young master of the Du household through some connections, for them to meet in this restaurant.

According to the rumours, the power of this Young Master Du was great within the household. The person who gave Qiu Fenghan advice said that if Young Master Du was able to say a word for her, then the formation metal and stone would very quickly be able to be sent to the front lines of the North East.

In this private room that would need half a year of Qiu Fenghan's wage, the [Flower of the Thunder God Army] recognized at first glance this young master. He was the young master who had been taught a lesson by her because he had made harassing comments to her because he desired her beauty.

The mysteries behind this matter was all unveiled.

The reason she was not able to obtain the resources of the army must be the work of this person behind the scenes.

Qiu Fenghan wanted to turn around and leave immediately.

But thinking back to the detainment of the formation stone and metal, it might affect the result of the battle between the Brute Race with the [Whip of the Thunder Deity]. It would also affect the lives of millions of soldiers of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army. Qiu Fenghan could not bear to just leave.

Suppressing the urge to vomit like she had just eaten a rotting worm, Qiu Fenghan accompanied Young Master Du to drink.

Then she was able to see a strange smile on the opposing party.

After, she could feel that the inner yuan inside her body could not be activated, as if it had been sealed.

"You... you put in the wine..." Qiu Fenghan slammed the table as she stood up, her shapely body wobbling. She had never imagined in her dreams that the opposing party would act towards an officer of the main army of the Empire, in such location, at such a time when countless people knew they were meeting.

"Hahahahaha, hahahaha..." The young Master Du that seemed gentle and elegant normally, laughed with sinister smile filled with lust. "The first time I saw you, I wanted to viciously ride you. I've sampled the taste of a female military officer before, but it's the first time I've seen a wildflower like you. I hear your title is the [Flower of the Thunder God Army]? Haha, then today I will definitely pluck a flower like you..."

"You... are looking to die!" In Qiu Fenghan's eyes, a killing intent exploded.

She madly activated her inner yuan, but it could not be used at all.

The face of Young Master Du was filled with mockery. "The effect of the [Sealing Yuan Pill], even if one is a Bitter Sea stage expert, they will lose their strength within fifteen minutes. As for you?"

The young officer, Zhao Yun that accompanied Qiu Fenghan, let out a roar of rage, and wanted to assist Qiu Fenghan to leave.

But the expert bodyguard by the side suddenly struck out in ambush.

Boom!

Zhao Yun was struck by a palm strike, the ribs in his chest cracking and breaking.

He spat out blood, his figure striking outside directly. Breaking apart the window, and the railings, he fell from the fifth floor.

He knew that he was definitely dead.

The injuries were too severe.

The last thing he could do was to use his own body, to use his fresh blood, to alert the people outside. If there were people that were able to see this scene and act heroically, perhaps sister Qiu would be able to escape from his demonic claws‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The great hall of the first floor.

"What happened?"

Some people slapped the table as they rose.

The table was broken and the delicious cuisine and drinks on the table were in a complete mess. The figure that fell down struggled for a bit, and then turned over. There was a clear and distinct palmprint on his chest as he spat out large amounts of blood The uniform he was wearing was a black-coloured military uniform. From his age, he was approximately twenty years old‚Ä¶

"A soldier?"

The complexion of the others faintly changed.

"This uniform... its our North East army...." After [Avalanche] was surprised, he instantly stood up. He bent up to assist the young soldier spitting out blood, inserting a stream of yuan qi inside him and assisting him to stabilize his meridians and life. Asking, "Brother, what camp do you belong to? Why are you here, what has happened..."

The aura of the young officer was weak. The injury on his chest was not light. As his eyes opened, he saw [Avalanche] and his eyes grew bright. Tightly gripping onto the arm of [Avalanche], "Deputy commander... You... you came here... Quick... Save... Save... save Qiu... save officer Qiu..."

The name of [Avalanche] was called Zhang Lei, and he was the deputy commander of the Vanguard that belonged to the North East army, [Whip of the Thunder Deity]. He was famed throughout, and this young North East officer had evidently recognized [Avalanche's] identity.

"Department head Qiu?" [Avalanche] was taken aback, then suddenly thought of someone. With surprise, "Qiu Fenghan?"

The young officer nodded his head, his finger pointing at the direction of the fifth floor. There was a jet of blood that spat out from the corner of his lips, and his head rolled back, dying.

"Brother? Brother?" [Avalanche] shook the young man, but the injuries were too severe. Nothing could be done.

Ye Qingyu lifted his head. He could see the direction where the young man pointed to on the fifth floor. On the location where there was broken railings, there were five or six noble rich figures gazing down, their eyes bold. One of them was namely the Young Master Du who they had encountered when they entered. Behind them were tens of guards that had decently strong auras.

The sound of footsteps.

There were six martial artists that wore purple clothing that charged at them.

The leading person was namely one of the expert bodyguards following beside the green-robed young master. Seeing the group, he frowned, then pointed at the young officer who had died. Using a commanding tone, "What are you people doing? Quickly scram away and hand over the corpse of that little thief.‚Äù

"Little thief?" [Avalanche] had rage on his face as he said angrily, "His identity is the officer of the Empire. It's you guys that are suspicious, just who are you?" Why do you want his corpse?"

The expression of the expert changed and snorted. "What dogfart military officer, this little thief just entered the fifth floor to want to steal the inherited jade piece of Young Master Du. After he was discovered, he jumped down and commited suicide. Who are you people, don't speak nonse and hand the corpse over.‚Äù

As he said this, he gave a sign.

The purple-clothed bodyguards by the side instantly charged at them and wanted to take the corpse off them.

Ye Qingyu took a step forward, blocking the past of several guards in front of him. Calmly, "Explain it clearly, then you can touch the corpse. Just who are you people?"

"Fine, I know now. You must be comrades of this thief. You are all looking to die, you have some guts." The eyes of the expert flickered as he immediately shouted.‚Äú

The customers who were originally watching this scene, hearing such words, suddenly had an understanding light. The expression they used to regard Ye Qingyu with all became filled with disdain.

"I don't have time to talk trash with you people. Where is head officer Qiu Fenghan?" [Avalanche] let out several slaps, sending several purple-clothed guards flying backwards that wanted to take the young officer's corpse off him. He advanced threatenly step by step towards the head expert.

"What Qiu Fenghan, I've never heard of that before." The expert coldly sneered. "You little thieves, to dare to pretend to be military officers of the Empire and coming here to con and scam. And you even dared to send someone to steal Young Master Du's items. I think you guys must not want to live anymore. I've heard rumours that assassins of the Brute Race have entered into the Capital. From your figures, you seem similar to the Brute Race. Today, none of you can escape."

As he spoke.

Chilala.

There were hundreds of experts wearing martial outfits that rushed at Ye Qingyu and the others. They completely surrounded them on all three sides.

The situation instantly changed.

"Everyone, everyone, my apologies. The Du household is currently capturing spies of the Brute Race, please leave everyone. Young Master Du will pay for everyones bills." There was a person that was like a magistrate that stood up and clasped his hands at the people standing there uncertainly. His tone was authorative and not to be questioned.

On the large hall of the first floor, there were people that immediately left.

The Du household was one of the famous powerful and noble families within the capital. Normal people could not incite them at all. As for this Young Master Du, he was famous for being cruel and he also had an official position. He was one of the most central characters of the noble young masters circle.

"You motherfucker, what nonsense are you spouting..." [Avalanche] was enraged and was about to act.

Chapter 363:


364 - Turn you into a corpse in the gutters

Ye Qingyu grabbed at him, saying, "Don't tarry here too long with these people, first let's save the person. Do you know the person called Qiu Fenghan?"

[Avalanche] nodded his head. "That's right, she is one of the military heads of the backline operations of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army..."

‚ÄúIf you know, then all is good. Follow me... my brothers, I'll leave the matter below to you. Protect the corpse of this little brother, do your best not to kill anyone," Ye Qingyu said something, his figure flashed. He directly headed towards the direction of the five or six noble figures rapidly. In an instant, he was in front of these figures and walked down through the hallway.

"Scram away."

An enraged yell.

A blade light exploded out from the fifth floor, that struck to kill everything in front of it. It's aura was extremely vicious.

Ye Qingyu let out a cold snort. Within the air, he grabbed and held this sword light.

The glimmer from the sword light retreated, it was a long steel blade.

Ye Qingyu's figure charged forward. With a movement of his palm, and a ping, the long blade was snapped in pieces.

The person who threw the sword was namely the other expert bodyguard next to Young Master Du.

His face was filled with shock and astonishment. He could only feel a powerful force that came along with the broken sword. His figure could not help but fly backwards.

Ye Qingyu's figure landed.

[Avalanche] also landed next to him.

"Find her." Ye Qingyu gave [Avalanche] a glance, and said in a low voice.

[Avalanche] nodded his head. He directly pushed open the doors of the private rooms and began searching one by one.

"Quickly stop, you dare..." the manager who had once welcomed the noble young master in green clothing suddenly charged forwards to block him, attempting to detain him.

"Scram away!"

[Avalanche] gave him a slight shove and the manager was sent flying.

"You are." Within the five or six noble young masters, there was someone with a furious face. Pointing at Ye Qingyu, he said, "Just who are you, to dare to be so mannerless in front of us. Do you know who we are?"

Ye Qingyu did not say anything. His consciousness slowly spread out around everywhere, surveilling everything around.

"Hmph, daring!" That noble young master shouted. "People come... what are you doing, capture him, capture him. Whoever dares resist, kill them."

There were two bodyguards that charged over.

The light of the blades were like lightning.

The glimmer of the swords was like a projectile.

Ye Qingyu stood where he was. Casually extending his hand, he grabbed the blade and sword with his hand. With a slight exertion of strength from his fingers, that blade and sword was crushed into scattered powder and sent flying backwards. Those two bodyguards that were around the sixty Spirit springs or so of cultivation, had no way of blieving the hilt that had left from their weapons. Their expression was like they had just seen a ghost, not daring to near and scrambled backwards in a panic.

Using his flesh and blood body to crush the weapons in their hands. The difference was too evident already, it was really really too great.

Within the capital, just when had such a young expert appeared?

The two bodyguard experts were not nameless people. In their brain, there were the names of countless famous experts that instantly flashed by, but none of them were similar to the handsome young man before their eyes.

"You're not allowed to retreat, kill him for me," the noble young master said angrily.

Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!

Immediately, another five or six experts charged forward.

Evidently, these young masters all originated from famous families within Snow Capital. They had exceptional background. What followed behind them were also top class Spirit spring experts. If they were elsewhere, or within the Jianghu, they would have long been famous experts. When they acted, a killing aura was like a hurricane that swept over, heading towards Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu let out a sigh.

For these people to reach the cultivation they did today, just how much effort and how much resources did they expend? Their original talent was decent, and if they used all that they learnt to protect the Human Race and fight against the alien races, they could contribute to the great duty of defending their homeland and to the flourishment of the Human Race. But it was a pity that people of such ability would willingly be ordered by nobles. For gold and silver, for status and power, they would abandon the pride and dignity of a martial artist, and did not distinguish from right and wrong. What difference did their actions have from a begging wild dog?

With a faint will of his heart, his finger acting as a sword, he swiped casually.

The will of the [Human King Sword Mantra] faintly activated.

A sharp, peerless invisible aura began emitting from the flat of his palm.

Ding!Ding!Ding!Ding!

The broken swords flew everywhere, the snapped blades madly danced.

The six experts that were charging over only felt a lightening of their hands. When they lowered their head to look, they could only see the weapons in their hands was as if it had been sliced apart by a divine weapon. It had been entirely cut apart.

"How is this possible?"

Someone exclaimed.

Since they had willingly sold their lives to noble families, the weapons in their hands was naturally rare divinely sharp weapons. They were all Spirit class weapons. Why did it snap into two if the opposing party just lightly swiped?

"Who are you? Please give us your name."

Of the six experts, the middle-aged man that was the strongest opened his mouth. His tone became much more respectful.

Such a level of expert was definitely not unknown.

Ye Qingyu acted as if he did not hear.

Bang!Bang!Bang!

He had already kicked open the doors of five or six of the private rooms, but [Avalanche] had still not yet discovered Qiu Fenghan's figure. There did not seem to be any clues or suspiciousness on the guests in the private rooms.

"I can't find her, what should we do?" [Avalanche] seemed worriedly impatient.

Ye Qingyu's gaze landed on the private room behind the several noble young masters.

He deeply breathed out and headed towards the door.

"Stand where you are." Young Master Du's complexion changed. Biting his teeth, "Young man, you must consider carefully. Your strength is perhaps very strong, but you must know that personal power does not represent anything. There are countless people with greater strength than you. Listen to my advice, if you leave today, I can pretend that nothing happened. But if you dare trespass over that door, then you cannot bear the responsibility.‚Äú

Ye Qingyu stopped his footsteps, his gaze landing on the face of this young noble master.

The faint smile on Young Master Du's face was both self-confident and certain.

Ye Qingyu's lips curved in a slight smile. Without delaying slightly, he barged right through them.

The surrounding air suddenly seemed to boil The experts as well as the noble young masters in front of him suddenly felt as if an invisible mountain had pressed against them. They could not block him in the least and was sent stumbling backwards.

"You dare, you are looking to die you little brat..." a noble young master said in rage.

Ye Qingyu did not respond at all.

"All move aside, let him pass." Young Master Du bit his teeth, a sinister killing intent on his face. " I want to see just what kind of daring fellow, to think he would act against my Du household. If he really steps past that door, then I will make his corpse lay on the gutters in the south tomorrow.‚Äú

He had gone completely all out.

Seeing that Young Master Du had said such words, those who were familiar with him knew, that this matter could not end peacefully.

The managers that rushed here after hearing the news were shaking from fear.

But Ye Qingyu did not pay attention to this in the least. In front of the crimson red door, he pushed and the door opened.

Xiu!

The instant the door opened, a dazzling swordlight struck out to kill from the crevice of the door.

There was a sword expert that hid behind the door, that had finally struck with the most terrifying attack.

"[War God], be careful." The expression of [Avalanche] changed. He knew that he was no longer in time to act.

The expert of the sword that ambushed, his strength was around the eighty Spirit springs. He had hidden and gathered his energy for this strike, it was exceedingly terrifying.

Ye Qingyu's complexion did not change. He did not even lift up one of his hands.

A silver light emitted from the silver hairpin on his hair. It clashed directly with this dazzling sword light.

There was a strange energy that exploded. The swordlight instantly froze, turning into ice. Even the person behind that was holding the sword was frozen at the same time, turning into an ice sculpture, his sinister killing expresion frozen on his face. His body and sword, could not even advance an inch further.

Walking past the ice sculpture with a calm expression, Ye Qingyu arrived at the number one private room.

The fragrance of wine assaulted him.

Tens of female dancers shivered as they looked at Ye Qingyu entering.

Compared to the glorious and rich decorations of the hall of the first floor, the arrangements of the number one private room was incomparably classic. There was running water as well as plants. Under the enhancement of the formation array, it was like a flourishing spring scene, causing one to feel relaxed.

"Where is she?" [Avalanche] quickly came over, his face dark as he swept his eyes over. "She's not here."

Ye Qingyu frowned.

"How is it, have you found the person you want?" Young Master Du had squinted his eyes as he faintly smiled. "To dare intrude on my private room and to injure my guards. You two things won't be able to bear such a crime‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before he had finished.

Ye Qingyu suddenly sensed something and grabbed at something through the air.

There was a peculiar ripple on the wall tens of meters away. Suddenly a shapely figure with her clothing in disarray fell from the wall.

So there was a space formation behind the wall.

"Department Head Qiu?"

[Avalanche] was able to recognize this shapely figure at first glance. She was namely one of the four requisitioning officers of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army, the person titled the 'Flower of the Thunder Army', Qiu Fenghan.

Currently, Qiu Fenghan's clothing had already exposed half her body. It exposed her white jade like hand, as well as her translucent jade like long legs. She seemed to be powerless, and in a state that was half conscious. A faint fragrance emitted from her lithely figure. Under the shine of the formation light, she let out a white radiance like she was white jade, and she had a beautiful outline that was enough to make one faint.

"Department head Qiu, are you okay?"

[Avalanche] took out a cape from his interdimensional storage, and covered the exposed portions of Qiu Fenghan's body.

Ye Qingyu extended his hand as he felt Qiu Fenghan's head, then was rest assured. "She has only ingested some sort of medicine that seaed her yuan qi." As he said this, a shred of [Supreme Ice Flame] went into her body and negated the effects of the [Sealing Yuan Pill] completely.

But Qiu Fenghan still did not wake up-----

Chapter 364:


Perhaps because the effect of [Sealing Yuan Pill] had not completely dispersed, or were there other residual effects?
Ye Qingyu didn‚Äôt care too much.
What he cared about most was that there were the sound of footsteps outside and a strong yuan qi rapidly coming closer, which indicated that the reinforcements of young aster Du had finally arrived. Ye Qingyu did not know what kind of power a top residence in the Snow Capital could mobilize, but he was sure of one next thing: what happens next can‚Äôt be solved through simple means alone.
As expected, from the hall of the first floor outside of the private room, there was a short bugle sound and military orders that resounded out‚Ä¶
An army has been dispatched.
Ye Qingyu‚Äôs gaze fell upon the face of a young master who wore a cold smile standing at the door.
A noble of the empire, a young nobleman that received the empire‚Äôs salary dares to be that arrogant, was unbelievable. This also showed just to what extent the noble class had decayed. [The Whip of the Thunder Deity] is one of the main fighting corps of the empire, known as the pillar of the Empire, But a little young master of a noble family dared to touch a military official of the Logistics Battalion of one of the main corps.
And looking at this, it seems that they had mobilized an army. Were they trying to kill them?
Ye Qingyu‚Äôs heart was in an unbearable rage. Like a volcano, it was about to erupt.
The Asura Killing Martial Heart. Once he was enraged and his will to kill invoked, he must see blood before it disperses.
‚Äú[War God], what do we do?‚Äù [Avalanche‚Äôs] face also grew serious. He obviously also heard the movements outside and sensed the waves of yuan qi, like a meteor in the night sky, shooting at a rapid speed outside of the restaurant.
This means that the other side‚Äôs reinforcements have arrived.
‚ÄúTake the people and leave.‚Äù Ye Qingyu restrained the killing intent in his heart and decided to leave here first.
It was best to not cause a big scene for now, and wait until they are back at the military headquarters to ask Qiu Fenghan what happened first.Ye Qingyu faintly felt that the incident tonight was not just solely the fact that Qiu Fenghan had fallen into Young Master Du‚Äôs trap because he desired her beauty. It was only the beginning of a huge vortex.
And this whirlpool is likely to be related to the contention among the major factions of the Empire.
‚ÄúBut, I‚Ä¶‚Äù
[Avalanche] was a bit shy.
Back at the North East army, he was also one of the many fans of Qiu Fenghan. Although they had little interactions, but he secretly had feelings for the [Flower of the Thunder Deity Army]. He felt embarrassed to carry the half-naked Qiu Fenghan.
Ye Qingyu gave a faint smile.
He did not expect the careless [Avalanche] to be so shy.
Without thinking much of it, Ye Qingyu waved his hand and an invisible force swept Qiu Fenghan over, and that big cloak was wrapped around Qiu Fenghan on his back. A sweet smelling aroma assaulted him that made Ye Qingyu‚Äôs heart beat a little faster, and then he strode towards the door in huge steps.
Young master Du and the other people, blocked him at the door.
‚ÄúI said, if you dare break into the number one private sky room today, I will make you into a rotting corpse on the gutter in the south of the city.‚Äù Young master Du‚Äôs eyes were flashing a vicious light, glaring at Ye Qingyu and other people like looking at the dead, his expression full of contempt and disdain.
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get lost, I‚Äôll make you a corpse now.‚Äù Ye Qingyu stepped forward in huge strides, imposing manner skyrocketing, as if the whole building was shaken.
The noble young masters were suddenly angry but also fearful.
Young master Du was standing in the same place stubbornly, and did not retreat an inch.
His face, gloomy and vicious, almost seemed like it would bleed.
The youngster called the [War God], his black hair was madly dancing, and his overbearing imposing manner was crushing them. Young master Du felt like a boat inside a giant wave that was going to be drowned at any time. He was so frightened that he was almost clutching at his chest, but he knew that at this time, he absolutely could not retreat. Even if he moved an inch, then the prestige that he painstakingly accumulated would completely fall apart.
Moreover, the most important thing was‚Ä¶
Young master Du also did not think that he must retreat.
Because‚Äî‚Äî
Swoosh!
The roof tiles on the top floor of the restaurant were penetrated through by numerous [Yuan Destroying Crossbow Arrows], like arrows of locusts, with a sharp and piercing sound, shooting towards the fifth floor.
Arrows brushed past their shoulders, tip of the hairs, and the top of the head of young master Du and the noble young masters, shooting towards Ye Qingyu and others that were coming out the private room.
It was all too sudden and unexpected.
The arrows were like lightning.
The crossbow shooters were obviously sharpshooters that have undergone rigorous training. Even though they were separated by roof tiles, they could so accurately avoid their own people. They neededto be at least a thirty Spirit spring expert to be able to do this.
Within seconds, the arrows were before his eyes.
Ye Qingyu‚Äôs eyes were flashing red, the killing intent in his heat was no longer suppressed.
With a long, loud roar, the huge [Beheading Wind] sword was instantaneously in his hand.
A backhand sword slash.
Cold air exploded out.
All the [Yuan Breaking Crossbow Arrows] instantly turned to pieces of ice and collapsed to the ground.
As Ye Qingyu took another step forward, he administered another sideways slash with his huge [Beheading Wind] sword.
The power of the sword was precisely aimed at young master Du and the others.
The frightening murderous spirit, as though it was an actual substance, was booming like a waterfall.
In a split second, the faces of the noble young masters that were vicious and fierce and full of pride, ridicule, and anticipation, were immediately turned to a panicked expression like they were being submerged by a tsunami‚Ä¶
At this moment, young master Du‚Äôs mind went blank.
He dared?
Does he really dare?
Is he really going to kill me?
How would he dare?
That cold killing intent that was directly heading over made young master Du feel like a collapsed ice cave. This moment, all his pride and self-confidence had wafted away like smoke. Fear that he had never experienced before filled him.
During the time of imminent danger, dozens of sword light suddenly diffused out from in front of Young master Du.
‚ÄúThief, you dare injure young master!‚Äù
‚ÄúProtect young master Du.‚Äù
‚ÄúStop the two thieves.‚Äù
‚ÄúKill them, chop them up and feed the dogs.‚Äù
But at the most critical moment, Du palace‚Äôs second wave of reinforcements had finally arrived.
Trembling with fear and almost wetting his pants, young master Du, under the protection of the guards, hastily withdrew to one side, no longer daring to stay.
Ding!Ding!Ding!
Broken swords were flying in all directions.
In the face of Ye Qingyu, who was emitting such strong killing intent, there were immediate injuries and deaths as the guards and masters of the Du Palace came into contact with him.
Even a Spirit class long sword, would be pressed to block the [Beheading Wind] sword in Ye Qingyu‚Äôs hand that had the will of the [Human King Sword Mantra] emanating through it. Like being sliced apart, their blades fell neatly into the pieces. There were some misfortunate experts that were unlucky and stood too far forward. Before they fully understood, their bodies had split into two.
Even till death, they had a look of disbelief on their faces.
How could the strength of such a young martial artist be so strong?
With one move, lives were being taken away?
In the Imperial capital, when had such a young God of Death appeared before?
Blood splattered!
Poof!
Young master Du, who had not had the time to withdraw from the battle circle, was splattered with blood all across his face, screaming and trembling all over. His legs felt like jelly and he could not move an inch and had to rely on the guards to help him.
‚ÄúThose who stand in my way will die.‚Äù
Ye Qingyu yelled, stepping out of the room.
The huge [Beheading Wind] sword was slashed across the air once again.
The guards and experts that were full of confidence and came here in the first instance hoping to be rewarded by their master, were now all frightened to death. The power of Ye Qingyu‚Äôs one move, like the deities, made these fifty or sixty Spirit spring level guards and masters to instantly understand that the youngster with black waterfall-like hair was a real master among the masters. They couldn‚Äôt win against him with numbers alone.
Before the sword light was out, everyone had already fled away.
Ye Qingyu spun around, carrying Qiu Fenghan on his back and directly jumped down from the fifth floor.
The hall of the first floor was crowded with one dense mass of patrol camp soldiers.
The other young experts, along with the body of the young officer Zhao Yun, were surrounded in a corner, following Ye Qingyu‚Äôs instruction before he left. Although each one of their faces was filled with anger, it was evident that they were suppressing the impulse to attack, otherwise the soldiers of the City Patrol Camp of the Empire would not be able to stop this group of fierce tigers and dragons.
‚Äú[War God] is back.‚Äù
‚Äú[War God], did you find her?‚Äù
‚ÄúShall we fight our way out?‚Äù
Seeing that Ye Qingyu had returned, the spirit of the young experts was boosted.
‚ÄúTake the corpse and let‚Äôs go.‚Äù
Ye Qingyu swept his eyes across the hall, taking in everything in sight.
He did not stop his stride. Letting out a bellow of rage, and with the huge [Beheading Wind] sword in his hands beginning to absorb light, taking in the energy of the Spirit spring of the dantian world. His imposing aura sent directly hurtling towards the soldiers of the empire‚Äôs patrol camp.
With his current strength, dealing with such common soldiers, imposing aura alone was enough to crush them.
Opposite, the soldiers that were standing in a tight formation were suddenly scattered by the sudden gush of power. The formation fell into disorder, like rice paper blocking a hurricane, there was not the slightest room to struggle, before they were directly sent flying.
Towards the ordinary soldiers, Ye Qingyu went easy on them and did not kill them.
Upon seeing the situation, the other young experts also followed behind.
On the steps of the fifth floor, young master Du, who had just recovered from his surprise, before he could wipe the blood on his face, he was resting his body on the banister howling, ‚ÄúStop them, stop them for me, who dares let them go, I want his life‚Ä¶‚Äù
But with Ye Qingyu and the other people‚Äôs strength, who could stop them?
Even if there were experts that came with formation shields to block Ye Qingyu‚Äôs way, in front of a swipe of Ye Qingyu‚Äôs [Human King Sword Mantra], they were instantly turned to scraps of ice. Even if there were powerful military officers that acted, when Ye Qingyu‚Äôs fist exploded with the power of the [Dragon Fist] mantra, they were sent flying backwards while spitting blood‚Ä¶
In a twinkling, Ye Qingyu arrived at the restaurant door.
The situation tonight was somewhat strange, and if it dragged on, the opponents‚Äô reinforcements would continue to come. After all, he and the other people who were unheard of would fall into a passive situation. As long as they could rush back to the military headquarters building, no matter how arrogant the forces of the Du Palace were, they would also not dare to attack there.
At that time, Ye Qingyu and the others would be in a position where they could not be defeated.
‚ÄúLets go.‚Äù
Ye Qingyu stepped outside of the restaurant and saw the formation airship outside.
But at the same time, an extremely dangerous feeling suddenly shrouded Ye Qingyu.
Under the dim light of night, he saw that above a tall building in the distance was a silver jade-like shadow under the large moon, a long and solitary solitude body stopped and flashed, like an illusion, and instantly disappeared. Then the next moment, the figure moved across hundreds of meters, arriving at the restaurant door.
Master!
A master of the Bitter Sea stage.
Ye Qingyu was momentarily startled, all his yuan energy were suddenly activated.
At lightning speed, the figure had invaded within one meters distance of Ye Qingyu.
A palm thrust was thrown out.
The palm image was bright as jade, without the slightest fire or sparks, striking towards Ye Qingyu‚Äôs chest.
Perhaps because the effect of [Sealing Yuan Pill] had not completely dispersed, or were there other residual effects?
Ye Qingyu didn‚Äôt care too much.
What he cared about most was that there were the sound of footsteps outside and a strong yuan qi rapidly coming closer, which indicated that the reinforcements of young aster Du had finally arrived.
