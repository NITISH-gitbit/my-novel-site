Chapter 829:


Chapter 846 The Grading Result of the Heaven Wasteland Domain



Having made adequate arrangements for Qin Hui and her son, Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing followed the divine guard and left the side hall via a paved path which led a kilometer or so to another smaller divine temple.

The security inside this temple was even stricter than that in the side halls.

The duo successively passed through two formations which were akin to danger surveillance installations and then three manual inspections before arriving in the deepest part of the divine temple while being led by a different human divine guard, who was wearing a white robe. Here, a small faint-silver portal formation was already in operation. Flickering a strange silver spatial formation beam, it conveyed a majesty as if it was a portal to paradise.

"The two of you, please."

The white-robed divine guard guided the duo to enter this formation.

The next moment, the formation was activated completely.

A silver splendor flickered.

The three of them vanished on the spot.

When his vision returned to normal, Ye Qingyu discovered that he was in a different divine temple, which, unlike the previous one, was filled with a rich and incredible spiritual qi. Its four walls were covered in intermittently-appearing formation beam patterns which he could not understand, while the place was pervaded by a pressure which caused one to tremble as if one was being gazed at by a crowd of deities.

In front of the trio was a well-lit path which led to an unknown destination.

At the end of the path was a white splendor which was rather dazzling. When a breeze blew from the direction of the path, a hubbub of what seemed to be arguing voices, or perhaps the roars of fiendgods, could be heard from the far end. It was all extremely strange.

"You two will have to wait here for a while." The guard pointed in the distance at the far end of the path. "This should be your first time coming to the congress divine temple, right? That over there is its core lobby. When someone arrives in a while, all you have to do is follow this path and enter."

Ye Qingyu nodded.

He was feeling a little nervous inside.

Beside him, Yu Xiaoxing lowered her head and breathed at a leisurely and drawn-out rhythm.

After thirty minutes or so.

Several figures appeared from the far end of the path and slowly walked toward the duo. One of them was angrily struggling while snarling and cursing, as if in a tremendous rage, yet was dragged along helplessly by two figures...

As they neared, Ye Qingyu discovered that the struggling figure was shackled by formation handcuffs and fetters, on which circulated a purple lightning beam which continually struck the body. Not a human, this expert's body was saturated with tremendous power which was at least of the Great Saint realm. Appearing rather old, the expert was cursing loudly in a language which Ye Qingyu had never heard before, but continued to be mercilessly dragged along by the two Demon Race divine guards...

"This is the leader of the Netherworld Race, You Jiuling, a Great Saint-realm expert. For going against the will of the Alliance of Domains' congress, launching the Netherworld Race into a battle against the Demon Race of the Great Wasteland Domain, and causing destruction upon the Great Wasteland Domain, he was arrested by the Alliance of Domains and faced trial today. It seems that he's very dissatisfied with the verdict, but this won't change his destiny. According to the Alliance's laws, he will be banished to the battlefield of the Sin Realm."

The white-robed divine guard explained things after seeing Ye Qingyu's curious eyes.

Upon hearing the whole thing, the latter was astounded.

A Great Saint-realm expert, and a race leader to boot, who destroyed entire realms at will could absolutely be considered a peerless villain. Ye Qingyu could imagine that the volition and arrogance of You Jiuling's former majesty were no different from those of an emperor. However, this was all reduced to ashes by the Alliance of Domains' crackdown. From merrily discussing his plans for hegemony one day to becoming a prisoner and being put on trial the next...

Is this the power of the Alliance of Domains?

Yu Xiaoxing held Ye Qingyu's hand a little forcefully.

Turning his head to look at this young woman, Ye Qingyu watched as she tried to calm down yet found it hard to hide her nerves, causing him to feel an abrupt pang in his heart.

Ever since he became acquainted with the Heaven Wasteland empress at Youyan Pass, he had never seen her show this kind of expression no matter the situation, be it when foreign races approached the Snow capital or when she was in danger within the chaotic windstorms. It was thus clear that the Alliance of Domains' authority and her worries regarding the final grading result had caused her to slip into great anxiety.

Despite being the Heaven Wasteland empress and being able to confront all crises with facility, she was nevertheless just a young girl who was not yet twenty after all.

She was bearing way too much weight on her youthful shoulders.

"You two may go in now." The white-robed divine guard pointed at a path ahead which was shrouded in light.

"Thank you."

After thanking the guard, Ye Qingyu inhaled a deep breath.

When he subsequently held Yu Xiaoxing's hand, neither person let go as they walked hand in hand onto the spotless white path, on which a silver misty splendor, emitted by jade-colored formations, engulfed the two young figures. Coming from the far end of the path, a kilometer ahead, was a dazzling light which made one nearly unable to open one's eyes.

Step after step.

Step after step.

The duo gradually neared the dazzling light at the end of the path.

Without the slightest of pauses, they walked out of the path and passed through the light.

Then...

The light suddenly became soft.

A breeze blew.

They opened their mouths to inhale air which could not be any fresher or more natural, and which carried a mild fragrance of soil and grass.

Ye Qingyu realized that they had arrived on a luxuriant stretch of grassland.

This was the time of the day when the sun, hanging at an angle overhead, was at its most radiant and beautiful, yet it was not exactly blazing. A few white clouds, as sluggish as a dog taking an afternoon nap, drifted in the azure heavens. Ye Qingyu had never been more amazed by the scene in the sky.

The duo was currently on a dangerously steep cliff, the top of which took up a surface area of nearly one hundred thousand square meters and was covered in extremely beautiful vegetation in jade and emerald shades of green. A faint spatial power appeared and disappeared intermittently in the air all around the cliff.

Everything was not quite the same as he had imagined.

Beside him, Yu Xiaoxing was also a little absent-minded.

However, they both quickly understood that this was only an illusory formation and not a real scene, and that this place was definitely the legendary so-called core meeting hall of the congress divine temple. Most likely, countless member experts from various domains were currently sitting on seats all around the illusory formation, attentively looking down at and observing the duo who simply could not see them back.

Just then, a voice was heard.

"The Empress of the Heaven Wasteland and Ye Qingyu, please step on to the Saint Hearing Platform."

This broad and great voice seemed to ring out throughout the world and resound in the heavens.

The Saint Hearing Platform?

Ye Qingyu looked around him and saw that in the centermost of the grassland was a greenstone pavilion with the words "Saint Hearing Platform" on its base. He had not noticed this initially because of the jade-green ground around it.

The duo proceeded forward and slowly stepped onto the Saint Hearing Platform.

The next moment, two greenstone jade slips suddenly floated down from the sky and suspended in front of the duo, flickering a faint fluorescence.

"The two of you, please check if there are any omissions or errors in the information on the slips."

The same voice resounded throughout the world with shades of majesty.

After exchanging glances, the duo each took a jade slip and injected a little yuan qi into it. Upon exploring it with their divine senses, they immediately knew what information was contained within.

It took only several dozen breaths' worth of time for Ye Qingyu to gain a clear idea of things.

These slips recorded all of the information and reports written about the Heaven Wasteland Domain by the special envoys who were previously dispatched there by the Alliance of Domains. The local customs and practices, resource geography, mountains and rivers, history and literature, and distribution of races and forces were all described in extraordinary detail from the perspectives of the envoys, whose evaluations were as sound and objective as possible.

The duo spent a full thirty minutes reviewing all of the information in the slips.

During this process, the duo seemed to be alone in an isolated and noiseless environment where around them were drifting clouds, cool breezes, and swaying trees. The earlier voice had not been heard again, affording the duo much patience.

After they were done reading, the duo exchanged glances and nodded.

"The records in the greenstone jade slips are indeed completely consistent with the real conditions of the Heaven Wasteland Domain" Yu Xiaoxing provided a definitive reply in a clear voice.

She was telling the truth.

It had to be acknowledged that the special envoys dispatched by the Alliance of Domains were extremely perceptive, such that their insights and judgments were absolutely spot-on. The information recorded in the slips were detailed, true, unexaggerated, and unfaultable.

"Very well."

The voice rang out once again, surging throughout the world.

The slips turned into flowing light and vanished as soon the voice was heard.

Imagining that the domain grading would be a lengthy process, the duo waited for the next set of inquiries. Moreover, the Heaven Wasteland Domain's circumstances were a little special, for it did not fully complete every test on the Road of Chaos. Prior to coming here, out of fear that something unexpected would arise, the duo had gathered all of the aides of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps in anticipation and rehearsal of various possible conditions...

But...

"The Heaven Wasteland Domain shall be deemed to have passed the grading."

The dignified voice airily offered this statement when it rang out once more.

The duo froze.

Their first response was not one of excitement.

Instead, they found it hard to believe.

Is passing the domain grading really this easy?

Nothing else had been asked or said. Neither of them had been asked to give a speech or make a convincing pitch of any sort. The final preparations collectively done by the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps were not of any use.

The best possible result came so suddenly that neither person responded for a while.

Just then, the voice was heard for a fourth time.

Chapter 830:


Chapter 847 - What Exactly Happened?



"The grading is complete. The Heaven Wasteland empress and Ye Qingyu, you may now leave."

The voice, which contained neither sorrow nor joy and only a modest dignity, directly announced the conclusion of the entire process without giving the duo any chance to speak.

Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing could do nothing but step off the Saint Hearing Platform.

When they exchanged glances, they saw that in each other's eyes were astonishment, surprise... and specks of shame and reflection.

Yes, shame and reflection indeed.

The entire Heaven Wasteland Domain had spent close to two years preparing for this and had paid a heavy price. The Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had sweated and bled along this journey, with hundreds of martyrs dying in foreign lands, and remained nervous about the ultimate goal throughout. Yet, in the eyes of the Alliance of Domains' heavyweights, this was nothing more than a matter of one sentence. Those airy words were all that it took to label the painstaking efforts of the countless beings of the Heaven Wasteland Domain over the past two years.

Although the final verdict was the outcome which they hoped for, the duo clearly felt that they were paid no regard to and were even despised.

It was a feeling that their destiny was in the hands of others who had the power to manipulate and even oppress them.

The duo did not say anything.

They did not feel the excitement they had imagined.

With their heads lowered and their expressions calm, they walked toward the bright path they had come from.

The cliff and vegetation behind them gradually disappeared.

Still too weak.

This time, Ye Qingyu truly felt the taste of being weak.

Taking very slow steps, Ye Qingyu earnestly reflected on the name he had made for himself by fighting and killing on the Road of Chaos over this period of time. Perhaps, it was not as frightening as he imagined it to be, and that was why during the final grading by the Alliance of Domains, he was not even qualified to see the congress members from the various domains, and was made to feel like a prisoner being summoned for a trial.

He had thought that he would be able to see Ren Puyang, who he had already ascertained to be the Mr. Ren being sought by Qin Hui, during this process and thereby conveniently explain the mother and son's case. However, there now appeared to be no such chance for the time being.

How can I account to Qin Hui and her son?

After some thought, he realized that the only thing he could do was to bring Qin Hui and her son back to the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps’ encampment in the Green Xuan Hall before contacting Ren Puyang through Yan Wushuang.

If that did not work, he would have to use the jade token which Ren Puyang had given him. Although it could only be used three times, each of which was worth a thousand pieces of gold, he had already made a promise to Qin Hui and so had to do it regardless.

Of course, what confused him even more was the fact that the congress merely announced that the Heaven Wasteland Domain had passed the assessment without explaining which grade of domain it was assigned, the specific processes of joining the Alliance, and what would be done regarding those special envoys who went missing in the Heaven Wasteland Domain. The entire domain grading process thus felt anti-climactic, with the final announcement as half-assed as a game which everyone eventually lost interest in.

The white-robed divine guard quietly waited at the end of the well-lit path.

"Having passed domain grading, the Heaven Wasteland Domain shall thereafter be brought under the Alliance of Domains' protection while existing as an independent domain. This should be good news, so why don't the two of you seem happy?" the guard asked with a smile.

"Perhaps we should be happy, but we still feel that something's lacking." Yu Xiaoxing laughed bitterly before she returned a salute and asked, "What's next? Are we to follow you back by the same route?"

"That would usually be the case." The guard nodded, but then turned to look at Ye Qingyu and smiled, saying, "But something has cropped up this time. Mr. Ren Puyang wants to meet the two of you, so please follow me."

With that, he turned and led the way.

Struck dumb, the duo quietly followed.

After entering a different portal formation from the one they came from, the guard held a secret key in his hand as he injected yuan qi power at a special rhythm to activate the formation, on which silver formations that resembled floating tadpoles began to flicker.

When their vision returned to normal, Ye Qingyu discovered that they had arrived in front of a pale-red wooden door.

On both sides were corridors which were laid with red dragon-patterned carpets, resembling the corridors of some palace, and appearing very quiet yet spacious. At the far end of the west corridor, warm sunlight shone in through the gap of a slightly-opened lapis window. A silver-armored divine guard stood quietly in the sunlight like a golden War God. Despite the distance, Ye Qingyu could clearly sense that this guard possessed power which he absolutely could not withstand.

"Mr. Ren Puyang is inside. The two of you may enter."

The white-robed divine guard gently knocked on the wooden door and then pushed it open to enter.

The duo followed him in.

"Your Majesty and Lord Ye Qingyu, we meet again."

A familiar and warm voice was heard. In this highly spacious room, the walls except for the one directly in front were covered by ceiling-high bookshelves crammed with ancient books. Below the west-side bookshelf was an extremely large blood-red wooden desk on which was arranged a hill of jade slips, and behind which was a simple wooden chair which did not even have a cover. Everything appeared simple and plain, with a method to the messiness. On the wall directly in front was, instead, a huge transparent lapis window through which golden sunlight shone into the room, causing the light in the entire room to be incomparably soft and natural.

A figure, with his back toward the duo, was standing in front of and looking out the window with his arms crossed.

Judging from the back view, this was none other than Ren Puyang.

Smiling, he turned his body to look at the two youths who had entered, then waved his hands, saying, "Come and see what's outside. I believe that you two will be interested."

"Mr. Ren." Ye Qingyu greeted before walking up to the floor-reaching window.

Upon looking outside, he felt a jolt in his heart.

Beside him, Yu Xiaoxing also let out a low cry.

Looking several hundred meters downward through the window, they saw a greenstone platform at the centermost of a suspended cliff which had a surface of nearly a hundred thousand square kilometers and was covered in luxuriant grass and jade-green trees. This was none other than the Saint Hearing Platform, where the duo had stood while receiving the final grading outcome of the Heaven Wasteland Domain.

In the Void all around the cliff were countless transparent floor-reaching lapis windows which were flickering with strange splendors. These windows seemed to be inlaid superficially in the clear blue sky and were exactly the same as the one in Ren Puyang's room. A cursory look suggested that there were at least tens of thousands of them.

In other words, behind this window were tens of thousands of rooms similar to the one Ye Qingyu was in.

And most likely, in every one of them was a person who was overlooking everything that was happening on the Saint Hearing Platform.

Ye Qingyu instantly confirmed his earlier guess.

The core central meeting hall of the Alliance's congress divine temple was indeed a giant formation divine temple. Anyone who had come to make an appeal or stand trial would stand on the Saint Hearing Platform, where they would be watched and observed by the congress members from different races, domains, forces, and camps.

During this process, the people standing on the Saint Hearing Platform would not be able to see the actual surroundings. They would only see the blue sky and white clouds which formed a beautiful natural environment, and not the true appearance of the surroundings of the congress' core hall.

Like deities judging earthly creatures from above, the congress members stood behind the lapis windows overlooking those jittery beings which awaited their fates. This made one feel one's self to be all-domineering. Even Ye Qingyu, who had experienced the feeling of being judged and controlled just a while ago, now experienced the indescribable feeling of dictating everything when he looked down at the Saint Hearing Platform, despite not being the owner of this room.

This was a very ingenious design.

At least, anyone who stepped into the core congress divine temple and got on the Saint Hearing Platform would start to tremble.

"Do you know why the announcement for the Heaven Wasteland Domain's grading would become this simple and half-assed?" Ren Puyang turned around and looked at the duo with a faint smile on his face.

"Become?" Ye Qingyu acutely caught hold of this word.

He immediately understood from Ren Puyang's words that the announcement should have been a very tedious, long-winded, and even ceremonious affair, but during this process, some reason cropped up and led it to become this simple.

"Yes. You must know that, for a very long time, no other domain has received such a simple and casual grading. Even for a newborn domain devoid of civilized beings, its grading and jurisdiction issues would be quarreled over by the Alliance's congress members for countless years. And even after all these have been settled, the handover process would take a long time." Ren Puyang looked out of the window at the Saint Hearing Platform below.

There was a strange expression in his eyes.

Ye Qingyu could not decipher what it meant.

He listened as Ren Puyang continued, "As for the Heaven Wasteland Domain, the emergence of such a vast domain of unlimited potential, which not only has bred several dozen races but also contains infinite mineral resources and opportunities, and which is rumored to be where a suspicious palace of the Formation Emperor has appeared before, ought to have given rise to insane contention. Honestly speaking, when the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps first stepped on to the Road of Chaos to receive all kinds of tests, everything was still up in the air. Given the circumstances at that time, even if your diplomatic corps perfectly completed all of the tests, the final outcome would very likely have been a grading fail... because the Heaven Wasteland Domain is too weak."

The duo was deeply astonished when they heard this.

"Mr. Ren, can you tell us what exactly happened later?" While looking at Ren Puyang, Ye Qingyu asked earnestly, "Why, in less than a month, did the Heaven Wasteland Domain's final grading outcome change?"

Chapter 831:


Chapter 848 - Someone Wants to See You



"In this world, there are only two types of things which nobody is willing to touch. The first type is stinky dogshit, while the second type is treasures which are beyond one's ability. The Heaven Wasteland Domain clearly belongs among the latter." Ren Puyang looked at Ye Qingyu and said laughingly, "To the various large domains and forces, subordinating the Heaven Wasteland Domain is something they've always wanted to do, and so, since the very beginning, none of them thought about allowing it to pass the assessment and obtain independence. However, they soon realized that it could no longer be subordinated by them. Even an idiot wouldn't choose to encroach on something which would cost them their life to obtain, no matter how beautiful it is or even if it's a rare treasure."

Ye Qingyu vaguely understood the meaning of these words, "Mr. Ren, do you mean that those covetous forces ultimately gave up because they suddenly realized that they didn't have the ability to encroach on the Heaven Wasteland Domain? That if they took forceful action, the consequences would be troublesome?"

Ren Puyang nodded.

"Is that really the case?" Yu Xiaoxing felt greatly surprised.

It turned out that it was for this reason that the entire process on this day was so half-assed and the grading of the Heaven Wasteland Domain was so anti-climactic. It actually made sense that this was the case. To give an analogy, when it is discovered that a stunning babe, chased by countless men, is already attached to a guy who is leagues ahead of all the other admirers, even the craziest among them would eventually lose their enthusiasm.

Since they could not obtain the Heaven Wasteland Domain, no force or race was willing to throw a grand celebration for the domain's passing of the grading on the Saint Hearing Platform in the core meeting hall. After hastily fulfilling the bare formalities, they wished never to see Ye Qingyu and his companions again, so as to avoid feeling upset and covetous.

Ye Qingyu was rather confused by this.

After pausing for a while, he said rather doubtfully, "According to what I know, even the most powerful Human Race forces aren't able to frighten all races and factions in this world. I believe that even if you'd personally said something, it would be unlikely for all evil forces to withdraw. And based on what I know, the entire situation changed in less than thirty days. Only one person could've managed this."

Ren Puyang guffawed.

"[Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] is indeed unrivaled. Almost as soon as he reemerged, he seized forty-one cities in thirteen domains, causing the Vast Thousand Domains to bow at his feet. No foreign race dared to test his might, and so they all retreated. This is certainly true, as is his declaration that he'd protect you." Ren Puyang laughed as he explained, "Make no mistake, this is one of several reasons why those with sinister ambitions dared not touch the Heaven Wasteland Domain. You should remember that His Highness' decree was to protect you for a hundred days, and didn't mention the Heaven Wasteland Domain. Reasonably speaking, the top-level forces in the Vast Thousand Domains could slowly do a couple of things over a long timeframe to probe His Highness' true will and bottom line. For instance, they could've followed what the Black Moon Immortal Palace did, which was to continually probe the strength of His Highness' will to protect the Heaven Wasteland Domain and then adjust their plans according to the feedback. Yet, they didn't do this."

The duo became a little stupefied.

It wasn't just because of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]?

If so, who else?

If it was someone or some force who has a voice in the Alliance of Domains, then, aside from Ren Puyang, it might be the Phoenix Race, the Black Demon Abyss, Storm City, or some other top-level force. Yet, none of them could've truly made all other forces bend to their will.

"Haha, alright alright, no need to make any more guesses. You'll eventually find out the real reason." With no intention of revealing the answer, Ren Puyang turned and glimpsed at Yu Xiaoxing. However, just as he was about to say something, he suddenly sensed her exhaustion and could not help revealing a strange expression which became increasingly distinct as he carefully sized her up, "Your Highness, are you suffering from an illness?"

The latter gently shook her head and laughed, "No, I'm just exhausted from all of my efforts over the past few days. Good thing is, the grading is over, and so I don't have to worry about anything else. I'll be fine after going back to the Heaven Wasteland Domain to cultivate for a while."

Ren Puyang acknowledged as he turned to look at Ye Qingyu, and subsequently changed the subject without bringing up this matter again, "Although only the final grading result was announced on the Saint Hearing Platform, there are actually several procedures which Your Highness has to complete. Perhaps Xiao Lincan bring Your Highness to settle these while brother Ye Qingyu stays behind, for I still have a few things to discuss with him."

Realizing that Ren Puyang was deliberately finding an excuse to get her to leave, Yu Xiaoxing was slightly stunned, yet she did not take it to heart and thus nodded with a smile, "Okay."

Xiao Lin, who was that white-robed divine guard, led her out of the room and disappeared into the side corridor.

The door of the room was closed back up.

Ye Qingyu did not say a word throughout this process. He was no fool, and naturally, like Yu Xiaoxing, could tell that Ren Puyang was deliberately getting her to leave so as to talk to him alone. But therein laid the problem. Ye Qingyu was very curious to know what exactly Ren Puyang wanted to say to him yet could not let Xing'er find out about.

"Actually, after passing the domain grading, the members of your diplomatic corps should by right be given an opportunity to enter the Alliance's [Infinite Arsenal] to observe and learn for a hundred days." Ren Puyang sighed. "However, the other core congress members shifted their disappointment in the grading result to this aspect, and so they didn't want to give the Heaven Wasteland Domain this opportunity."

Ye Qingyu quipped, "Looks like the Alliance's rules aren't as inviolable as legend has it."

"But the problem is... As a matter of fact, the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps didn't complete all of the tests, and instead only completed about one-third of them," Ren Puyang calmly said.

"This wasn't because of us. It was the Alliance which allowed us to end the tests in advance." Ye Qingyu began to frown.

Ren Puyang laughed, "It would be meaningless to get caught up in these problems at this time. I've already done my best to allow you alone to enter the Alliance's [Infinite Arsenal] for ten days."

Ye Qingyu did not say anything.

Although he previously did not know that there would be such a reward after passing the domain grading, now that he knew, a final compromise like this was certainly not all too satisfactory.

"I heard that you have photographic memory?" There was a slyness in Ren Puyang's smile as he winked at Ye Qingyu.

The latter was taken aback.

Ren Puyang continued, "The techniques and secrets you obtain from the arsenal can be cultivated by others as well."

Ye Qingyu now completely understood.

If he went into the [Infinite Arsenal] and memorized those techniques and secrets, he could later impart them to the world when he returned to the Heaven Wasteland Domain.

"Thank you, Your Honor." Ye Qingyu was very grateful.

"You, child, are truly one of those people who only does things when there's an incentive. You finally learned to thank an old folk like me, huh?" Ren Puyang laughed. "I did all this because I hope that the next generation of human geniuses like you can grow up as quickly as possible. If the Human Race can produce one or two more experts of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei's] level, then I, as a spokesperson for the Human Race, wouldn't be bullied like I was today."

When he heard Ren Puyang speaking like this, Ye Qingyu sprang up hurriedly and declared, "I certainly wouldn't dare allow you to be bullied."

Ren Puyang burst into laughter once more.

Evidently, his mood was pretty good today.

"By the way, Mr. Ren, I believe that you kept me here alone not only to talk about the [Infinite Arsenal], right?" Ye Qingyu waited for him to be done laughing before asking.

A weird smile formed on Ren's face as he nodded, "Of course... Hmm, actually, I kept you here not because I wanted to talk to you, but because there's someone who wants to see you alone, and that's why I had to send Her Highness away first."

"See me alone? Who is it?" Ye Qingyu was rather surprised.

Anyone who could request a favor from Ren Puyang was certainly an important person of considerable status which was at least on par with him. However, despite racking his brains, Ye Qingyu could not recall knowing any such person in the Alliance of Domains.

"You'll find out when you get there." Ren Puyang laughed secretively as he pointed a finger, causing a mysterious and profound layer of formation patterns to flicker in front of him, before a miniature portal formation opened up in the room.

Ye Qingyu was inwardly awed by this sight.

Ren Puyang's cultivation was frighteningly immense, unfathomably deep, and neck-bendingly lofty. It seemed that, with just a simple gesture, he had opened up such a stable portal formation. This was something which Ye Qingyu certainly could not do given his present cultivation.

Trying to hold back his impulse to ask questions of it, Ye Qingyu walked toward the micro portal formation. Just before stepping in, he paused his footsteps and took out Qin Hui's jade token, saying, "While I was in the side hall, I met a pair of mother and son who had been waiting for six days and six nights in there. They wanted to meet a certain important person called Mr. Ren, who I then presumed to be you, and so I took it upon myself to help them bring this jade token here."

"Huh?" A look of surprise appeared on Ren Puyang's face when he saw the jade token in Ye Qingyu's hand. After receiving it, he finally seemed to recall something and said, "This is a nameplate which I once gave to a disciple of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect. Are these mother and son his descendants? Hmm, I shall go take a look. That person once did me a favor... Why hasn't he come personally to find me instead?"

"You'll know when you get there and ask." Without saying anything further, Ye Qingyu stepped into the formation without hesitation or doubt. This was because he trusted that Ren Puyang would not harm him, and thus knew that the person who wanted to meet him was definitely a friend and not a foe.

The next moment, a splendor flickered.

The empty feeling of being teleported by the formation lasted only for a fleeting moment.

Ye Qingyu had arrived in a different place.

It was a room that was all but identical to Ren Puyang's.

A giant floor-reaching transparent lapis window occupied the entire southern wall. If it was not for a gentle and graceful female figure standing by the window, Ye Qingyu would really have thought that he was still in the earlier room.

Is it really her?

========================================

Chapter 832:


Chapter 849 - The Dark Holy Girl
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden?
Ye Qingyu recognized her right away despite only seeing her back. It turned out that the important person who wanted to see him, as mentioned by Ren Puyang, was the Celestial Phoenix Maiden. He wondered how the relationship between Ren Puyang and the Phoenix Race could be good enough for the maiden to request from the former a meeting with him, and soon understood why Ren Puyang used an excuse to get Yu Xiaoxing to leave first.
In front of the giant floor-reaching lapis window, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden was dressed in purple and golden Phoenix battle garments, with her lavender-colored long hair flowing down like a waterfall. Her bearing was elegant and upright, and her waist was slender and lissom. True Phoenix aura faintly exuded from her body, which descriptions like "pure and noble" or "mysterious and lofty" did no justice to. She seemed as though she simply did not belong to this world and could never be contaminated by its dirtiness.
During that instant, Ye Qingyu suddenly felt captivated for some unaccountable reason.
As such, he was a little out to lunch for a moment.
This was a very weird feeling.
It was the first time Ye Qingyu looked at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's back so absorbedly and vividly. Even he himself did not know why looking at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden this time felt so different from the previous times. Nor did he know what the differences were.
But he quickly recovered from his brief daze.
Recalling something, a smile formed at the corner of his lips.
Previously, at the gate of the Phoenix Race's station, he had asked the Celestial Phoenix Maiden whether she would rush here to witness the final outcome of the Heaven Wasteland Domain's grading, to which her response at that time was an unclear "I'll try my best". Knowing how busy she was, he did not carry much hope that she would come - he did not even know why he would ask this sort of question.
Yet, she ultimately managed to get here in time.
He could imagine that she was standing in front of this transparent lapis window, watching him and Yu Xiaoxing as they stood on the Saint Hearing Platform during the moment when the grading result of the Heaven Wasteland Domain was announced. As they say, a friend's promise is worth a thousand gold. He thus wondered if he and the Celestial Phoenix Maiden could now be considered sworn friends.
He could not help smiling faintly.
Just then, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's voice was finally heard.
"You're here."
Amid the familiarly cold and unapproachable voice was a cheerfulness which only Ye Qingyu could feel.
Sensing Ye Qingyu's familiar aura, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden slowly turned her body.
Beneath the glossy Phoenix mask was a beautiful pair of limpid and bright eyes which possessed the world's purest luster, and in the depths of which was a hint of delight.
Ye Qingyu laughed as he walked toward the window and nodded, "I'd never thought that it would be you who wanted to see me. To tell the truth, I was a little nervous when Mr. Ren secretively mentioned this to me earlier, for I'd imagined that it would be a bigshot of the Alliance of Domains instead. If I'd known that it was actually you, I wouldn't have needed to be so nervous, haha. By the way, the Heaven Wasteland Domain's grading wouldn't have gone so smoothly without the great help provided by the Phoenix Race, so thank you so much."
Although Ren Puyang had explained a huge chunk of why the Heaven Wasteland Domain's grading went so smoothly, Ye Qingyu knew deep down that the Phoenix Race's covert assistance played a considerable part, and so he expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps at the first opportunity.
"Since we're already friends, there's no need to be so courteous. What's more, you protected me and saved my life in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. I definitely had to repay such a big favor." The Celestial Phoenix Maiden's eyes lit up like a starry night sky as she looked at Ye Qingyu. Her tone was also not as hostile as it would be toward others, and possessed a brisk and barely-noticeable tenderness.
The Phoenix Race's sole supreme genius and successor was innately cold and distant, and had always been rather cautious and unconsciously indifferent when dealing with people and things. However, ever since the life-and-death ordeal she went through in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss, Ye Qingyu had breached the line of caution in her heart and became someone whom she identified as a friend, and so she was completely open toward him.
Furthermore, as a matter of fact, only she knew exactly what place he occupied in her heart.
In front of the floor-reaching transparent lapis window.
Standing shoulder to shoulder, the two of them looked down at the cliff and the Saint Hearing Platform.
Below.
Another case had begun in the core meeting hall.
A Demon Race expert half-knelt on the Saint Hearing Platform, tightly furrowing his brows and revealing an unusually-serious and agitated expression. He was waving his four arms as if vehemently making an appeal, but his voice could not be heard. Clearly, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden had shut out the noise from the platform as she was not too interested in this case.
Though she was standing at the window, it did not automatically mean that she was keen on observing the situation outside.
Ye Qingyu sighed as he looked at the Demon Race expert standing on the Saint Hearing Platform below. He had just stood on that platform himself and thus knew what it felt like. After the expert had made his appeal, the congress members' judgment would decide the destiny of his race and domain, for better or for worse.
The weak would forever be controlled by others.
The weak would forever be a pawn in someone else's game of chess.
When he left the Heaven Wasteland Domain, Ye Qingyu thought that he had jumped out of the chessboard. However, after coming to the Road of Chaos and seeing the true colors of the Vast Thousand Domains, he realized that he had merely jumped from one square to another on the chessboard.
Several breaths later.
Ye Qingyu withdrew his sights.
At this time, he helplessly discovered that, beneath the mask which brimmed with flowing light, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's eyes were gradually becoming hollow while her thoughts had wandered off in some distant direction, like rootless duckweed in a rapid torrent.
Oh my... what a time for her to... go into yet another trance!
Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.
He had frequently seen her go into a habitual trance when they were in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss, but because they were not too familiar with each other at that time, he did not ask about it despite his curiosity. Later on, when the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps was in the Phoenix Race's station, those zealous elders would talk about her natural habits in front of him, whether intentionally or otherwise. As a result, he had a rough understanding of why she often went into a trance, and had become inured to it by now.
The atmosphere abruptly became a little silent.
Reluctant to interrupt her train of thought, he looked away from her and out the window at the Demon Race representative on the Saint Hearing Platform. Although the expert wanted to provide further justifications, he was eventually brought away against his will by two black-armoured divine guards.
At this time, a strange and mysterious orchid scent drifted near.
It was as faint and light as that of an Immortal.
It quietly wafted past the tip of Ye Qingyu's heart.
He gently turned his head and looked sideways to find the source of this scent.
This was clearly a closed room, yet a breeze blew from nowhere and raised the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's thick waterfall-like green hair, every strand of which was flickering with a strange splendor, and on which seemed to blossom many elegant and beautiful orchids... The scent was from the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, and was a type of female body scent which could make all males in the world become infatuated and go crazy.
Ye Qingyu could not help taking a few more sniffs of it.
A full ten minutes went by.
It was only now that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden suddenly woke up and regained her senses.
"Ah... I went into yet another trance... Pardon me, please take a seat." She smiled apologetically, with her eyes appearing a little dazed beneath the mask.
Subsequently, she turned her body and walked toward a red armchair with wood-carved flowers.
However, Ye Qingyu suddenly noticed something when she turned.
"You... were wounded?" A tinge of shock appeared on his face.
Because of the drop of rainbow-colored Phoenix blood in his body, he was very familiar with the power and aura of the Celestial Phoenix Maiden. In particular, he could detect the aura of her Phoenix true-vitality keener than anyone else, including the experts of the Phoenix Race. During the moment when she turned her body, he detected a trace of an unusual aura. Although it was extremely weak and had even been concealed by the Celestial Phoenix Maiden using an advanced technique, he still managed to catch hold of it instantly.
"Oh... It's nothing, just a small injury, that's all. No biggie." She spoke in a nonchalant tone.
She casually pointed a finger.
As a splendor flickered, a pale-red stone chair appeared in front of Ye Qingyu.
He sat down on it, with his expression remaining doubtful and surprised.
What exactly happened?
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden possessed the purest Phoenix blood and was originally already considered an outstanding talent among the younger generation of the myriad domains. Yet, after attaining nirvana, her strength increased at an even more heaven-defying rate. Furthermore, given that the Phoenix Race was a super large force among the myriad domains, her innate strength was already unfathomable. It was no exaggeration to say that the Phoenix Race devoted all of its strength toward protecting her. Under these circumstances, only a handful of people within the myriad domains could hurt her.
Could it be because...
His thoughts swirled and his eyes quivered.
This was because he suddenly recalled the conversation in front of the Phoenix Race's station.
At that time, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden said that she wanted to go investigate the movements in the Unmoving City of Darkness.
Could her injury this time be due to... the Unmoving City of Darkness?!
After some hesitation, he could not refrain from asking, "Is your injury because of the Unmoving City of Darkness?"
Having no intention of withholding the truth, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden gently nodded her head, "Indeed, it was. Before coming to Heaven Connect City, I encountered the dark holy girl and fought against her. She was very strong, and so we were both wounded."
Chapter 849 - The Dark Holy Girl



The Celestial Phoenix Maiden?

Ye Qingyu recognized her right away despite only seeing her back. It turned out that the important person who wanted to see him, as mentioned by Ren Puyang, was the Celestial Phoenix Maiden. He wondered how the relationship between Ren Puyang and the Phoenix Race could be good enough for the maiden to request from the former a meeting with him, and soon understood why Ren Puyang used an excuse to get Yu Xiaoxing to leave first.

In front of the giant floor-reaching lapis window, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden was dressed in purple and golden Phoenix battle garments, with her lavender-colored long hair flowing down like a waterfall. Her bearing was elegant and upright, and her waist was slender and lissom. True Phoenix aura faintly exuded from her body, which descriptions like "pure and noble" or "mysterious and lofty" did no justice to. She seemed as though she simply did not belong to this world and could never be contaminated by its dirtiness.

During that instant, Ye Qingyu suddenly felt captivated for some unaccountable reason.

As such, he was a little out to lunch for a moment.

This was a very weird feeling.

It was the first time Ye Qingyu looked at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's back so absorbedly and vividly. Even he himself did not know why looking at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden this time felt so different from the previous times. Nor did he know what the differences were.

But he quickly recovered from his brief daze.

Recalling something, a smile formed at the corner of his lips.

Previously, at the gate of the Phoenix Race's station, he had asked the Celestial Phoenix Maiden whether she would rush here to witness the final outcome of the Heaven Wasteland Domain's grading, to which her response at that time was an unclear "I'll try my best". Knowing how busy she was, he did not carry much hope that she would come - he did not even know why he would ask this sort of question.

Yet, she ultimately managed to get here in time.

He could imagine that she was standing in front of this transparent lapis window, watching him and Yu Xiaoxing as they stood on the Saint Hearing Platform during the moment when the grading result of the Heaven Wasteland Domain was announced. As they say, a friend's promise is worth a thousand gold. He thus wondered if he and the Celestial Phoenix Maiden could now be considered sworn friends.

He could not help smiling faintly.

Just then, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's voice was finally heard.

"You're here."

Amid the familiarly cold and unapproachable voice was a cheerfulness which only Ye Qingyu could feel.

Sensing Ye Qingyu's familiar aura, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden slowly turned her body.

Beneath the glossy Phoenix mask was a beautiful pair of limpid and bright eyes which possessed the world's purest luster, and in the depths of which was a hint of delight.

Ye Qingyu laughed as he walked toward the window and nodded, "I'd never thought that it would be you who wanted to see me.
