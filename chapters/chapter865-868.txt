Chapter 865:


Smoke and dust filled the air.

Blazes flew in all directions.

Ye Qingyu took a large step forward.

Meanwhile, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] appeared behind him, spinning as it released a mysterious powerful aura. As it suspended in mid-air and hung down a bright-yellow ribbon of light, mysterious rformations circulated and protected Luo Yi, Qin Hui, and her son within, preventing them from being affected by the fight.

The entire palace was in a state of shock.

Nobody had expected that, in what originally looked like a picture of harmony, the two men would come to blows because of a single disagreement upon meeting. Cang Li and the traitors of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect had assumed that the new sect master would have some form of countermeasure and never imagined that things would pan out like this. They more so did not expect that the usually-invincible sect master would be unable to withstand a single strike from Ye Qingyu.

For a while, they dared not intervene at all.

A fight like this was not one they as Immortal Step realm experts could get involved in.

Boom!

Bits of stone flew out from among the smoke and dust.

Like a cannonball, a figure charged out from within and directly at Ye Qingyu.

"Still not giving up, I see." Giving a loud shout, Ye Qingyu struck a punch forth, shattering a huge section of the Void in front of his fist at once. It became visible that a huge section of the thunderously-crackling air had been turned into a vacuum.

Boom boom boom!

One after another, air energy waves radiated frenziedly within the palace.

Exerting punch after punch, each of which contained sufficient force to collapse a mountain range, Ye Qingyu suppressed the advancing momentum of the sect master, who had just charged out from among the rubble, and caused him to fall backward.

"You... have truly pissed me off, ughhh!" The sect master bellowed as he struggled, desperate to fight back.

His voice did not contain a trace of human feeling. Despite being engulfed in flames, he continued to punch forth frenziedly and showed no sign of giving up as he traded blows with Ye Qingyu, causing slurry orange-colored flames to spray in all directions. The frantic atmosphere in the palace only intensified, while the ground began to burn after becoming besmirched by the orange slur.

Boom!

Unparalleled in might and vaguely possessing an earthshaking force, Ye Qingyu's final punch shattered the sect master's arms and aimed directly for the latter's heart.

Bam!

An orange slur burst out and spattered.

This punch caused the sect master to literally explode and turn into a sky full of flares and slurry.

Ye Qingyu withdrew his fist and stood up straight. His black hair danced like streaks of black thunder while his white robes were distinctive among the sky full of flares. As an invisible vigor emanated from his body, the orange slur, which was powerful enough to burn rocks, was no longer able to get within ten meters of him. He appeared as majestic as an armorless War God, and became too dazzling to be looked at from up close.

However, there was dismay rather than joy on his face.

This was because he had detected that, after being blown up by him, the sect master's aura not only did not dissipate but even grew stronger than before. Things were certainly not as simple as they seemed on the surface.

"What are you waiting for? Kill him for me already."

The sect master's voice rang out in the palace.

During this moment, the eyes of Cang Li and his henchmen suddenly gleamed in a changeful blood-red. Subsequently, their bodies stiffened as a red radiance flashed across them, and the flaming armor on their bodies seemingly began to burn. Turning into streaks of lightning with a swishing noise, they swarmed toward and surrounded Ye Qingyu.

"Huh?"

Ye Qingyu shockingly discovered that the bodily auras of Cang Li and his henchmen had transformed within an instant. Becoming like scorching suns, their power went beyond the Immortal step realm and reached the Saint realm. As they struck out, a heavenly fire began to circulate and instantly turned the entire palace into a sea of fire.

"Be careful, my lord." Qin Hui could not help herself from crying out.

Ye Qingyu stood on the spot, as unmoving as a mountain.

Just then, snowflakes appeared all around him, dancing and hovering. As an invisible chilly force field sprang up, Saint realm laws began to circulate within ten meters of his body, turning him unassailable and rendering Cang Li and his subordinates completely unable to draw near. No matter how powerful and intense the bombardments, anything that reached within ten meters of Ye Qingyu would instantly disappear and be unable to cause even the slightest of stirs.

"Have they been possessed?"

As Ye Qingyu watched the transformations of Cang Li and the other Ancient Sky Dragon sect elders, he was able to discern what was strange about them. Every one of them was utilizing a technique which did not belong to the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect. Instead, it was a bizarre, seemingly-otherworldly flame power with an ancient chaotic aura, and furthermore comprised of an extremely obscure evil aura which Ye Qingyu felt was vaguely familiar.

Swish swish swish!

An air-breaking whistling noise rang out incessantly.

Becoming near-invisible, the figures of Elder Cang Li and the members of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect rapidly spun around Ye Qingyu and eventually fused into a flaming ocean of orange, apparently intent on enwrapping Ye Qingyu and burning him alive.

Ye Qingyu did not offer an immediate response.

His expression became ever weirder as he observed his surroundings.

He could feel with gradually-increasing clarity that the sect master's aura was growing more and more powerful although he could not be seen in the palace, while the vigor of Cangli and the others was also rising non-stop concurrently and had vaguely already broken through to the Half-Saint realm.

Chapter 866:


Chapter 883 - Puppet Bloodworm


"Ye Qingyu, I shall burn you and turn you into my most powerful flaming puppet. Haha, I offered you an easy way out but you chose the difficult route yourself!" The new sect master's voice reverberated in the Void like the resonant vibration of millions of rocks, inhuman and thunderous. "I wanted the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain specifically because this place has been forsaken by the myriad domains and is out of the spotlight. You've courted your own death by deliberately coming here to foil my plans. It's predestined that you'll become the flaming puppet I use to kill those Great Saints with, hahahaha!"

"Flaming puppet?"

Ye Qingyu appeared deep in thought upon hearing this.

He began to understand the state which Cang Li and the others were in.

He had guessed wrongly earlier. They were not possessed, but had rather been burned alive into flaming puppets.

If that's the case, does that mean Cang Li and the others had lost their lives long ago, and all that's left are their bodies?

With this conjecture in mind, Ye Qingyu suddenly raised his hand and grabbed at the Void in an extremely casual fashion. However, when he retracted his palm, he was holding onto a figure who was none other than Elder Cang Li.

After they were activated using the sect master's secret technique, Cang Li and the other elders turned into beams of dancing light which fluttered at a rapid speed that could not be seen by the naked eye, and emitted a destructive scorching-hot force that would quickly burn an average Half-Saint expert into ashes. However, they were no different from flying birds and fireflies to Ye Qingyu, who could easily catch hold of them by raising his hand.

A silver-colored cold light diffused from Ye Qingyu's palm.

After Cang Li struggled for a bit, the orange slurry flames on his body were extinguished by this chilly light and his aura changed tremendously. As the weird scorching force disappeared, he reverted to the look of the time when Ye Qingyu first saw him. Although he then stopped struggling, his eyes did not regain their former spirituality and vitality, leaving him with a dull and vacant expression as if he was a piece of rotten wood.

"He has indeed been burned into a puppet. His spirit has died and all that's left is his body. He can no longer be revived."

Ye Qingyu was able to form a clear judgment with just a glance.

His palm gave a slight shudder.

Boom!

Elder Cang Li's body turned into a puff of icy mist and dissipated.

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

Since his spirit has already died, it's probably best for him to vanish completely so as to prevent his body from being made use of by others and thereby allow him to rest in peace. This kind of ending might even be a form of release for him. Perhaps, it was never his intention to betray the young sect master of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, and he had simply been manipulated involuntarily.

However, Ye Qingyu did not expect that, during the moment of dissipation, a beam of blood-red light would shoot out from the icy mist and charge straight toward himself at lightning speed.

"Huh? Is this the thing that was covertly manipulating Elder Cang Li inside his body?"

Ye Qingyu was taken slightly aback.

However, he remained fearless and did not seek to evade it. Instead, he opened his mouth and sucked this streak of blood in. The long-prepared bright-yellow Immortal qi gushed up his throat and swirled around his mouth, quickly sealing this streak and turning it into a blood pill before he spat it out.

Landing in Ye Qingyu's hand, the pill spun in circles and emitted a strange and changeful light.

Ye Qingyu could vaguely see that at the bottom of the pill was a hidden bloodworm which rapidly wandered within, desperately struggling to escape from the seal. At present, through careful attention, he could feel that the worm's aura was evil like no other, carrying with it a dense and asphyxiating power of darkness.

After retracting his divine sense, Ye Qingyu looked at the blood pill thoughtfully.

Although he seemed close to putting together a few fragmented clues, it still felt like a few things were missing.

He did not pay too much thought to this.

"Everything is over."

He raised a hand to seal this blood pill into the [Cloud Top Cauldron] before the circulation of the Saint realm laws caused the bodies of the several dozen elders who, ten meters away, were still frantically spinning around him like heavenly scorching meteors to instantly freeze.

As the icy force field expanded, the flames in the palace were extinguished and could no longer be seen. Silver ice patterns crept all over the floor while a chill pervaded the entire palace.

The bodies of the elders turned into magnificent clusters of icy mist, accompanied by thumping noises.

Just like Cang Li, their spirits had long perished, leaving only their dead bodies.

That was why Ye Qingyu did not need to hold back.

And indeed, from among those changeful and pretty clusters of icy mist, puppet bloodworms which were practically invisible to the naked eye shot out at extreme speeds. Possessing consciousness and intelligence of their own, they frantically fled in all directions, apparently terrified by Ye Qingyu's Immortal qi and aura.

However, Ye Qingyu had long been prepared. Raising his palm, his sword will circulated. Galvanized by the true meaning of the [Human King Sword Mantra], a bright-yellow Immortal qi formed a net out of strands of thread and ensnared every one of those bloodworms.

"Hisssss!"

A strange low-frequency bellow rang out in mid-air as those puppet bloodworms wildly struggled to escape from the sword will net.

However, having attained the Saint realmand been through countless top-level life-and-death battles, Ye Qingyu now possessed a perfect understanding of the [Human King Sword Mantra] and could summon ten thousand swords with just a single thought. The bright-yellow Immortal qi, which was innately already the nemesis of those puppet bloodworms, instantly turned them into bright-colored blood pills as soon as Ye Qingyu retracted his sword will.

When the blood pills entered his hand, they began to spin and gave off a peculiar splendor.

Their shape, aura, and unusual internal state were exactly the same as those of the first blood pill. However, the evil and dark forces within them were considerably weaker, which could probably be explained by the fact that Elder Cang Li was the strongest among them.

Ye Qingyu guessed that the new sect master had planted those strange bloodworms in the bodies of Cang Li and the others, whose spirits were thereafter devoured by these bloodworms until only a wisp of them were left, and thus their senses and intelligence were preserved. Because they seemed no different from living humans, it would usually go unnoticed that their consciousness was being controlled by the new sect master, who, in his desperation upon exploding from the punch, fully activated the power of the puppet bloodworms in them, and thus destroyed the final wisp of spirit left in them. Hence, even if Ye Qingyu did not pulverize them, they would only remain as moving corpses and could never come back to life.

Instead, death was a form of release.

Ye Qingyu sighed faintly.

As the saying went, a pitiful person always has a deplorable side.

In this universe, any form of [Puppet Demon Seed] technique could only be implanted in someone by finding one's mental flaws.

Elder Cang Li was formerly a prestigious and distinguished member of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, and wholeheartedly served the old sect master who was able to control him. However, after the latter died and was succeeded by a younger person who did not possess sufficient virtue or capability to control him, his ambitions gradually swelled and flaws developed in his mind, giving the mysterious new sect master an opportunity to implant a [Puppet Demon Seed] in him and thereby control him.

Despite his ambitions, being a decent person after all, Elder Cang Li would not have brazenly launched a rebellious campaign so soon, and more so would not have wiped out the loyal disciples of his sect, if it was not for this new sect master. Even if he wanted to fill the boots of the old sect master, he would most likely have used relatively gentler methods, for the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect was where his heart was when all was said and done.

The other elders, who were also implanted with puppet bloodworms, were probably the same case.

Ye Qingyu vaguely guessed as much.

This, in fact, was close to the truth.

However, he had completely no clue as to the origin of the new sect master.

Just then...

Boom!

"The puppets I painstakingly implanted have all been destroyed by you. Ye Qingyu, you shall make up for this with your death."

The new sect master's voice rang out again.

The ground began to tremble.

The entire Divine Dragon Palace shook so badly that it seemed like it was collapsing. As an asphyxiating and scorching-hot aura surged out from among smoke and dust at the back of the palace, the silver-colored ice patterns which had pervaded the palace gradually faded away. A human figure, formed from orange sludge, stepped out from the depths of the palace.

Everywhere he passed, even rocks would begin to burn.

Every footprint left behind a cluster of flames.

Even the Saint realm icy force field which Ye Qingyu had set up was destroyed by these flames, with its chill dissipating and its ice patterns melting.

The palace became half ice and half flames.

Ye Qingyu's expression became significantly grimmer than before.

The new sect master had transformed into a being of lava and fire. His vigor and power had grown countless times from before and his figure had expanded several times. At present, he was three to four meters tall, akin to a flaming giant.

Is this his true form?

A monster born of fire?

Frowning, Ye Qingyu vaguely felt that things could not be so simple, for if it was indeed a monster born of fire, it would at most possess a demonic aura and should not be able to control the puppet bloodworms and such evil creatures. After all, fireborns were considered a spiritual species too.

Moreover, the flaming giant ahead was able to derive power from the ground ceaselessly, such that its vigor kept increasing at an astonishing rate with no end in sight.

"Interesting." Ye Qingyu laughed.

He gave a push behind himself.

The dozens of sealed blood pills fell into the [Cloud Top Cauldron], which then carried Qin Hui, Luo Yi, and Tian Ning into the air, breaching the Divine Dragon Palace and suspending several hundred meters up high, where they were away from the battlefield and thus could avoid becoming involved.

In the meantime, the new sect master had already launched his offensive.

A flaming giant fist struck out as if intent on blowing up the entire stretch of land and mountains. It contained a terrifying power which could change the color of the sky and was several hundred times stronger than his previous attacks.

"Haha, I shall crush your spirit while preserving your head and body so as to create a most wonderful puppet." The new sect master's voice was akin to a fierce roar.

Ye Qingyu stood on the spot with his body as straight as a divine sword, completely unmoving.

Boom boom boom!

Punch after punch slammed forth.

The fists collided.

Heavenly fire flew off in all directions like flowing light through a dark night.

Unable to withstand the feedback force, the giant flaming arms of the new sect master were pulverized, yet would reassemble and strike forth again time after time, with the power and terror of every strike several times those of the previous strike.

However, Ye Qingyu remained as unflinching as an ancient divine mountain where he was. No matter how terrifying the punches of the new sect master became, he was easily able to meet them, such that the bursts of flowing light and flames could never reach within one meter of his body.

After ten breaths.

"Not enough!"

While holding back his strength, Ye Qingyu delivered a punch forth.

Boom!

The arms of the flaming giant were instantly pulverized by this unprecedentedly terrifying punch. Its body was knocked back and exploded into a Sky Full of swirling flames which splattered all over the palace...

Ye Qingyu took a big step forth amid the skyful of flames.

He had already detected that a wisp of dark-red flowing light, which was probably the true life core of the new sect master, was making a beeline for the depths of the palace.

"If that's all you have, then it's time to end everything." Ye Qingyu hurried toward the depths, in the direction that the true life core of the sect master had fled.

Chapter 867:


Chapter 884 - Day of Apocalypse
After chasing into the depths of the palace, Ye Qingyu casually flicked a hand.
A chill began to diffuse while the smoke and dust in the air instantly dissipated.
Visibly, the throne of the Divine Dragon master had completely collapsed, and an enormous and unfathomable pit had opened up in its place.
Despite being no more than ten meters wide, the pit seemed to be several dozen kilometers deep. A tumbling, earsplitting noise could be heard from below, sounding like the roars of evil demons in the Ninth Hell. Billows of black smoke spewed from the depths, containing a horrid scorching power.
The true life core of the new sect master had fled right into this bottomless pit of thick black smoke.
After transforming into flowing light, Ye Qingyu leapt into the pit to give chase.
Like a chilly beam of lightning, he cut through the scorching smoke as he dove down at extreme speed, instantly pulverizing all impediments. In a twinkling, he had already traveled ten kilometers down, where an orange light was flickering and the temperature was scorching to an indescribable limit.
Am I already at the bottom?
He paused for a moment.
Just then...
Boom!
An extremely scorching beam of orange light shot directly at him.
"[Human King Sword]!"
Sword qi arose in accordance with his thoughts.
As a beam of flowing light burst forth, a boundless sword will instantly annihilated the beam of orange light.
Ye Qingyu paused his advance, while purple lightning flickered in his eyes which had a perfect view of everything around.
The bottom of the abyss was akin to the interior space of a volcano. Nevertheless, it was incomparably vast, with a circumference of several kilometers. Boiling lava tumbled frenziedly and boundlessly, resembling a raging ocean in a storm. The terrifying temperature was enough to incinerate a Heaven Ascension realm pinnacle expert at once. In extremely bizarre fashion, the entire space had been dyed in a ghastly orange-red color and was warped like melted transparent glass.
After reaching this place, the true life core of the new sect master disappeared without a trace.
Not even the slightest bit of aura was left behind.
With the silver-colored Human King Sword Will looming around him, Ye Qingyu stood in the Void, completely unaffected by the environment. Lightning formed in his eyes once again as the mystery of the [Eyes of the Void] burst forth. Sweeping his divine-like eyes across, he took in everything within several hundred kilometrers.
"Huh? That's..."
With extreme shock, he discovered that something seemed to be concealed in the depths of the surging lava below.
Upon careful examination, he realized that it was a huge figure, which stretched several hundred kilometers, that was hiding in silence. It resembled an underground winding range of lofty mountains, vaguely possessing a life aura of its own. Although Ye Qingyu was unable to see clearly what it was through the several kilometers of orange-colored top-grade flaming slurs, he sensed an inimitable visual impact at just one glance. This caused even an expert like him to shudder out of fear.
What exactly is it?
Alarmed, he was about to take a second look when an unusual change occurred.
A huge flaming lava palm silently appeared behind his head and, like the legendary giant spirit's Hand of Destruction, mercilessly smashed toward him. Strange and terrifying flame formations circulated on it, locking the Void all around him.
"[Human King Sword Mantra]... [Sword Storm]."
Without moving, he conjured a thought. Countless streaks of silver-colored sword will shot out and bombarded the giant spirit's flaming palm, which became ice-sealed by the surging chill. Subsequently, the palm broke off inch by inch, turning into pieces of ice crystal which fell into the sea of flaming lava below, and disappeared with only a puffing sound of vaporization.
Yet, at the same time, huge waves manifested on the sea of flaming lava.
Several hundred meters tall, they lashed brazenly toward Ye Qingyu.
Murderous spirit abruptly emerged all around the space.
"Haha, I knew you couldn't keep hiding. Demon, show yourself!"
Guffawing, Ye Qingyu forcefully turned around and employed the [Eyes of the Void] to the maximum level. The lightning beams in his eyes became like supreme divine swords, giving off a divine meaning which smashed downward and shattered the huge waves on the orange sea of flaming lava. A giant composed of flaming lava, several kilometers tall, could thereafter be seen hiding beneath the huge waves, from where it was whipping them up.
Its aura was unmistakably that of the true life core of the new sect master.
This flaming lava giant turned out to be the true form of the new sect master.
"Could he actually be a flaming spirit?" Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.
Nevertheless, he acted without hesitation. Bending five fingers, his yuan qi surged forth, causing the sword meaning of the [Human King Sword Mantra] to reappear. Countless white streaks of sword will circulated like ice chains upon bursting out from his fingers, and as they frantically dove downward, they instantly froze the ocean of flaming lava within an area of several hundred meters and bound the flaming giant within.
The might of a Saint was
that
great.
The flaming giant roared angrily while struggling.
He had fled here with the intention of making use of the geographical advantages and invoking the power of the entire ocean of flaming lava to deal with Ye Qingyu. Never did he imagine that he would remain far inferior to the latter while hiding and launching surprise attacks, and would so quickly be shackled by chains of sword will.
The latter's power made him feel a sense of despair and terror.
"I don't believe it, this is impossible..." The new sect master bellowed as his giant body writhed and struggled frantically while the orange-yellow flames within him gave off a fierce and dazzling radiance. However, he was unable to get free of the entwining chains of sword will and cold light.
"He isn't a flaming spirit, for he's unable to truly invoke the power of the lava ocean..."
Ye Qingyu quickly discovered an irregularity.
If the new sect master truly gained Dao from the underground lava, then he was probably a flaming spirit, who should be capable of manipulating all of the power of this stretch of underground fire lava. As this power was the true power of the land, even a portion of it would be very terrifying. Therefore, if he was indeed a flaming spirit, Ye Qingyu's [Human King Sword Mantra] would absolutely not be able to entrap him.
Instead, he was completely unable to trigger the full power of the underground fire lava despite struggling fiercely and becoming more powerful than before. This showed that he was a fake who was way inferior to a true flaming spirit.
"Looks like I have to capture him in order to ascertain what he really is."
As Ye Qingyu operated the [Limitless Divine Way], the power of his sword will gushed forth. White icy sword will diffused throughout and seemed to freeze the entire space of underground fire in a twinkling, also causing the temperature of the surroundings to plummet. Countless streaks of silver-colored sword light shot forth from Ye Qingyu's palm and completely sealed the flaming giant within, before hauling him up from the orange lava little by little.
"Ughhh... no, you can't be this powerful, I'm not convinced." He absolutely did not expect that he would remain unable to challenge Ye Qingyu having led him here and tapped on the power of the underground fire lava.
It became evident that the strength of his opponent was a lot greater than alleged by the final estimation of Elder Ming Jue's investigation previously.
It was a miscalculation.
"Ugh..." Accompanied by an angry bellow, the body of the flaming giant was hauled up from within the orange underground fire lava. In a twinkling, its orange light vanished before it turned into black rocks, losing its spiritual energy and breaking apart. It then fell tumbling into the sea of underground fire lava below, splashing up huge waves of fire.
A beam of blood-colored flowing light flew out of the broken body of the flaming giant, wanting to escape.
It was the true life core of the new sect master.
But Ye Qingyu was already well prepared. He opened his mouth and blew out a beam of bright-yellow Immortal qi which rapidly enwrapped the beam of blood-red flowing light and sealed it within with just a gentle coil. Like the others, the beam turned into a bright-colored blood pill and spun around and around in mid-air.
Having lost its spiritual energy, the flaming giant's body disintegrated completely in mid-air and fell into the lava sea below. This body had been put together by the new sect master using some kind of technique, and now that his true life core had departed from it, it lost its support and became nothing but a dead object.
Ye Qingyu retracted his [Human King Sword Mantra].
The surrounding chill disappeared at once.
He raised a palm for the blood pill to fall into.
Like the other puppet bloodworms which he had sealed earlier, its surface was as bright as fresh blood. However, being the size of an adult human's fist, it was a lot bigger and contained many times more energy than the others, and it seemed as though a Saint was imprisoned within. By looking past the surface of blood patterns, one could vaguely see that a dark-red splendor was circulating within, resembling a wandering and struggling black snake.
"A black snake? Could he be a Black Snake Demon? But this aura is not a demonic one and is instead an evil force, which is in fact so evil that it makes me shudder. A normal snake demon cannot possibly possess such a terrifying evil qi. This is getting confusing."
He looked at the blood pill in his hand with some uncertainty.
"Young fellow human, release me immediately or the day of apocalypse will befall and rip you into pieces..." A psychic force, which was none other than the aura of the new sect master, emanated from the seal. It was akin to the evil aura of a chaotic evil beast and was as terrifying as an apocalyptic king.
"The day of apocalypse?" Ye Qingyu laughed as he sent a streak of divine consciousness across. "What big words. To think a tiny little bloodworm would dare to lie about an apocalypse."
"Junior, you clearly don't know what kind of beings you've offended. The remote ages were all destroyed by us. If you obediently let me go and willingly become my slave, you'll be granted a place of your own when the day of apocalypse arrives, otherwise..." Roaring, the psychic force of the new sect master incessantly transmitted fitful wisps of divine consciousness through the seal of the blood pill.
Frowning slightly, Ye Qingyu considered for a while and did not continue the conversation. Instead, he added another layer of Immortal qi seal to seal the blood pill completely off.
Then, he lowered his head and looked once more at the orange-colored lava sea below.
The image he had seen earlier when using the [Eyes of the Void] showed up again in his mind. Several kilometers below in the lava ocean, the winding creature which resembled a dragon or a snake appeared to be hibernating. It was extremely frightening and was absolutely not a common creature.
"Should I dive down to take a look?"
Ye Qingyu could not make up his mind.
Chapter 884 - Day of Apocalypse

After chasing into the depths of the palace, Ye Qingyu casually flicked a hand.
A chill began to diffuse while the smoke and dust in the air instantly dissipated.
Visibly, the throne of the Divine Dragon master had completely collapsed, and an enormous and unfathomable pit had opened up in its place.
Despite being no more than ten meters wide, the pit seemed to be several dozen kilometers deep. A tumbling, earsplitting noise could be heard from below, sounding like the roars of evil demons in the Ninth Hell. Billows of black smoke spewed from the depths, containing a horrid scorching power.
The true life core of the new sect master had fled right into this bottomless pit of thick black smoke.

As this power was the true power of the land, even a portion of it would be very terrifying. Therefore, if he was indeed a flaming spirit, Ye Qingyu's [Human King Sword Mantra] would absolutely not be able to entrap him.
Instead, he was completely unable to trigger the full power of the underground fire lava despite struggling fiercely and becoming more powerful than before. This showed that he was a fake who was way inferior to a true flaming spirit.
"Looks like I have to capture him in order to ascertain what he really is."
As Ye Qingyu operated the [Limitless Divine Way], the power of his sword will gushed forth. White icy sword will diffused throughout and seemed to freeze the entire space of underground fire in a twinkling, also causing the temperature of the surroundings to plummet. Countless streaks of silver-colored sword light shot forth from Ye Qingyu's palm and completely sealed the flaming giant within, before hauling him up from the orange lava little by little.
"Ughhh... no, you can't be this powerful, I'm not convinced." He absolutely did not expect that he would remain unable to challenge Ye Qingyu having led him here and tapped on the power of the underground fire lava.
It became evident that the strength of his opponent was a lot greater than alleged by the final estimation of Elder Ming Jue's investigation previously.
It was a miscalculation.
"Ugh..." Accompanied by an angry bellow, the body of the flaming giant was hauled up from within the orange underground fire lava. In a twinkling, its orange light vanished before it turned into black rocks, losing its spiritual energy and breaking apart. It then fell tumbling into the sea of underground fire lava below, splashing up huge waves of fire.
A beam of blood-colored flowing light flew out of the broken body of the flaming giant, wanting to escape.
It was the true life core of the new sect master.
But Ye Qingyu was already well prepared. He opened his mouth and blew out a beam of bright-yellow Immortal qi which rapidly enwrapped the beam of blood-red flowing light and sealed it within with just a gentle coil. Like the others, the beam turned into a bright-colored blood pill and spun around and around in mid-air.
Having lost its spiritual energy, the flaming giant's body disintegrated completely in mid-air and fell into the lava sea below. This body had been put together by the new sect master using some kind of technique, and now that his true life core had departed from it, it lost its support and became nothing but a dead object.
Ye Qingyu retracted his [Human King Sword Mantra].
The surrounding chill disappeared at once.
He raised a palm for the blood pill to fall into.
Like the other puppet bloodworms which he had sealed earlier, its surface was as bright as fresh blood. However, being the size of an adult human's fist, it was a lot bigger and contained many times more energy than the others, and it seemed as though a Saint was imprisoned within. By looking past the surface of blood patterns, one could vaguely see that a dark-red splendor was circulating within, resembling a wandering and struggling black snake.
"A black snake? Could he be a Black Snake Demon? But this aura is not a demonic one and is instead an evil force, which is in fact so evil that it makes me shudder. A normal snake demon cannot possibly possess such a terrifying evil qi. This is getting confusing."
He looked at the blood pill in his hand with some uncertainty.
"Young fellow human, release me immediately or the day of apocalypse will befall and rip you into pieces..." A psychic force, which was none other than the aura of the new sect master, emanated from the seal. It was akin to the evil aura of a chaotic evil beast and was as terrifying as an apocalyptic king.
"The day of apocalypse?" Ye Qingyu laughed as he sent a streak of divine consciousness across. "What big words. To think a tiny little bloodworm would dare to lie about an apocalypse."
"Junior, you clearly don't know what kind of beings you've offended. The remote ages were all destroyed by us. If you obediently let me go and willingly become my slave, you'll be granted a place of your own when the day of apocalypse arrives, otherwise..." Roaring, the psychic force of the new sect master incessantly transmitted fitful wisps of divine consciousness through the seal of the blood pill.
Frowning slightly, Ye Qingyu considered for a while and did not continue the conversation. Instead, he added another layer of Immortal qi seal to seal the blood pill completely off.
Then, he lowered his head and looked once more at the orange-colored lava sea below.
The image he had seen earlier when using the [Eyes of the Void] showed up again in his mind. Several kilometers below in the lava ocean, the winding creature which resembled a dragon or a snake appeared to be hibernating. It was extremely frightening and was absolutely not a common creature.
"Should I dive down to take a look?"
Ye Qingyu could not make up his mind.

Chapter 868:


Chapter 885 - Revival
After a brief hesitation, he decided to dive down to the bottom of the orange lava ocean to find out what it was all about.
This was because he had vaguely felt that a huge secret was very likely to be hiding at the bottom. The enormous winding creature carried whiffs of dragon qi, which Ye Qingyu was most sensitive to having cultivated the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] before. Since he had come to this place, there was no harm in venturing down to take a good look.
Conjuring a thought, a force field of Saint realm laws spread out around him, forming a silver-colored light shield.
He slowly sank down.
The temperature of the orange-colored lava was terrifyingly high, such that a normal Immortal Step realm expert could not last for more than a short time in it before being incinerated and perishing. Afraid of being careless, Ye Qingyu opened up the Saint realm force field so as to keep the orange lava ten meters away from himself.
In only a twinkling, he had already dove several hundred meters deep.
He once again used the [Eyes of the Void] to look downward.
The expression of shock on his face grew even more intense.
"Is that actually... really... a dragon?"
He simply could not believe what he was seeing.
The enormous winding figure at the very depths of the orange flaming lava turned out to be an incomparably-massive dragon, and a real one at that. Sweeping his [Eyes of the Void] across, Ye Qingyu could vaguely see its scales, fins, claws... and head.
A True Dragon?
He remained a little doubtful.
Various legends in the Vast Thousand Domains naturally contained depictions of dragons, while it was also said that the Divine Dragon Race was a long-lasting and mighty race during the ancient Fiendgod Age, when their outstanding battle strength was comparable to that of the fiendgods. And in the legends of later generations of many different races, the Dragon Race was considered to be the embodiment of power, mystery, and invincibility. However, as time passed, the Dragon Race's population shrank until it neared extinction at present. Ye Qingyu himself had never seen a True Dragon, nor had he heard of them appearing anywhere before.
Many years ago, he had seen a snow dragon in the Snow Ground Demon Race's territory, but this was not a progeny of the Dragon Race albeit its body did flow with a little of the Dragon Race's blood, and could not be considered a True Dragon.
True Dragons aside, even the nine legendary offsprings of the dragon had all gone extinct and represented greatness.
The giant figure in front of Ye Qingyu was just as impressive as the artistic depictions of a True Dragon. When Ye Qingyu had dived to approximately three hundred meters away from the bottom of the ocean, he could see with utmost clarity that it was indeed a True Dragon that was sleeping soundly. The shape of every one of its parts was exactly the same as that which Ye Qingyu had seen in many ancient books, proving that it could not be from a sub-race.
The body of this massive creature was several kilometers long, and the smallest scale on it was as large as the roof of a divine temple. It coiled in perfectly round circles with its head facing its tail, reminding one of an Eight Trigrams chart. Completely motionless, it laid dormant within the flaming lava, with a layer of something gray in color covering its body. At first glance, it resembled a giant underground statue, but Ye Qingyu could sense a vitality surging within it and thus knew that it was no dead object.
The Ancient Sky Dragon Domain!
The Ancient Sky Dragon Sect!
These words flashed across his mind.
He suddenly realized that the origin of this ancient domain and Human Race sect might indeed be related to the legendary Sky Dragon. By looking back at history, this domain should probably have some long-standing myths and legends. Unfortunately, he did not pay special attention to this type of information when he first arrived, and only now suspected that there could be some such information that was related to the massive True Dragon that was hibernating below.
Otherwise, it surely could not be such a coincidence for a massive creature like this to appear beneath the main palace of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect.
Besides, from the look of things, it had been here for an extremely long time, and had certainly been coiled up in hibernation for more than just a few hundred years.
After some consideration, Ye Qingyu continued to draw near to it slowly.
The body technique he had cultivated was the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] which was imparted to him by the mysterious spirit from a million years ago, and so the True Dragon ahead seemed to bear some connection to him, while his instincts did not detect any kind of danger whatsoever. For any warrior, to see a True Dragon was always an exceedingly rare opportunity.
Soon, he was less than a hundred meters away from the hibernating True Dragon below.
He was as small as a speck of dust in front of this unimaginably colossal creature.
At these depths, the orange flaming lava was scorching to a terrifying extent, and even a Half-Saint realm expert would most likely be incinerated at once. Luckily, Ye Qingyu was a true-blue Saint realm expert and had cultivated a wisp of Immortal qi, and thus was able to endure it with some difficulty.
However, his diving route ahead was obstructed by an invisible power.
"What sort of power is this?"
Ye Qingyu reached a hand out to press on it.
He only now discovered that blocking his way was an invisible shield in the Void ahead. Although his palm created a concave palm print on it, it remained firm like no other and easily withstood his might, before returning to its usual form when he retracted his hand.
After several attempts, Ye Qingyu ascertained that although this invisible shield looked soft, it was actually extremely tough and indestructible, such that his strength was not enough to break through it.
"You want to save this old dragon? Hoho, give it up, that's impossible." The new sect master's voice was heard from within the sealed blood pill.
Ye Qingyu was taken slightly aback.
How did this wicked voice pass through the seal on the blood pill once more?
He opened his palm, on which the blood pill then reappeared.
The black snake-like creature rapidly wandered and flounced about inside the blood pill while its voice was intermittently heard, "Junior, do you really think you could've defeated me if it wasn't for the fact that I used more than half of my power to maintain the [Great Captured Dragon Glimmering Array] for the sake of devouring this old dragon? You must be dreaming if you think you can rescue it when it's already near death and will die even if rescued. Hehe, besides, you can't break through my array anyway. Hahaha, give it up."
It turned out that the array below had been set up by this Black Snake Demon.
Did it really intend to devour a True Dragon, like what it said?
Its ambition certainly ain't small.
Realizing that it had to possess some really frightening techniques for it to be able to keep the True Dragon in captivity all this time, Ye Qingyu developed a cold sweat on his back. The Black Snake Demon was unlikely to be lying, and if it had not been preoccupied with this True Dragon, perhaps he would not have been its match.
However, at present...
"If it was set up by you, perfect. Now, tell me how to break it." Ye Qingyu transmitted a streak of divine consciousness across.
"Kekekeke... Junior, that's not something I'll tell you, forget it." The voice in the blood pill sounded a little pleased. "Unless you release me, otherwise..."
Hearing this, Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry for a moment.
He felt that the Black Snake Demon's IQ was a little on the low side.
Unfortunately for it, it only had a small amount of the wonderful thing that was brains.
As he conjured a thought, a wisp of Immortal qi shot forth from his palm and pierced into the sealed blood pill, after which it burst out a power of annihilation, intent on killing the Black Snake Demon.
"Ughh... what are you doing... How dare you... No... Junior... You're truly cruel... I said it, I said it... Now stop."
Squealing like an old hen that was being cut up, the Black Snake Demon soon yielded.
It had no choice, for divine weapons were absolutely its nemesis.
The reason why it was so thoroughly defeated by Ye Qingyu today was that he had cultivated a wisp of Immortal qi which suppressed it completely and rendered its puppet bloodworms and true life core unable to hide. As a result, it was unable to utilize many of its methods. Had it instead faced any other Saint realm expert, even a pinnacle Saint realm one, it would certainly have had a fair chance of winning.
After obtaining the method of breaking the array, Ye Qingyu gave it a quick try and found out that it truly worked.
However, he was in no hurry to break the array.
"You said earlier that you set up the array here because you wanted to devour this True Dragon. What was that about?" Ye Qingyu asked by transmitting another streak of divine consciousness.
"Devouring a True Dragon naturally strengthens one's body. There's nothing odd about it. This old dragon has been hibernating in the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain for countless years and should've died long ago, having lost its former power due to old age. It's fortunate to have been discovered by me. After consuming it, I'll be able to truly control and devour the power of the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, hahaha..." The Black Snake Demon laughed wildly.
Devour the power of a domain?
Ye Qingyu suddenly understood a few things.
Tian Huayu had said that the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain still had a thousand years or so to go before it was completely destroyed. However, when Ye Qingyu himself entered the domain and saw to his astonishment how rapidly the situation within was declining, he estimated that it would not last for more than a few hundred years. He now wondered if that was because this Black Snake Demon had devoured its domain power behind the scenes.
What kind of monster is this exactly?
How is it able to devour a domain's power to speed up its destruction?
He could not help feeling a bout of fear.
I've never read about such a creature in the ancient books and records... Could I be overthinking?
Although the Black Snake Demon possessed sentience, it was nothing special, and the fact that it was acting so arrogantly despite being held in captivity indicated that it could never amount to anything great. Therefore, Ye Qingyu was not too worried about it.
Without asking further, Ye Qingyu conjured a few more strands of Immortal qi power and sealed the blood pill completely, amid the crazy roars and curses of the Black Snake Demon.
Subsequently, he broke the [Great Captured Dragon Glimmering Array] using the technique which the demon had revealed.
As ripples flickered within the orange flaming lava, the invisible light shield disappeared and booming blares were heard. A near-substantial True Dragon aura swept head-on at him, shocking him and causing him to hurriedly step back. The fiery flowing light below boiled gurglingly and surged toward the incomparably-massive dragon body, on which the layer of gray dust-like material was visibly dropping off in flakes, and into which the lava was flowing.
Subsequently, scarlet dragon veins began to flicker bit by bit on the dragon body, and in a twinkling, the scales across several dozen kilometers of the body lit up in brilliant splendor. An even more terrifying and vigorous True Dragon aura began to surge and seethe as the flaming lava all around it gathered with increasing frenzy on the dragon body and flowed within, as if wanting to ignite the entirety of it.
The situation was shocking like no other.
Ye Qingyu took continuous steps backward.
This process went on for thirty minutes.
More than seventy percent of the lava from this vast underground orange flaming lava ocean was absorbed into the giant dragon's body, which, despite its size, did not seem able to accommodate such a huge volume.
Like a drying-up lake, the level of the orange flurry ocean was falling, and had reached a point when it no longer submerged the dragon's back.
Ye Qingyu was hovering in mid-air.
Whoo...!
A breath spurted from the nostrils of the giant dragon, instantly forming a cyclone.
As the dragon revived, two columns of light abruptly appeared from below.
It opened its eyes.
Like divine swords, its eye beams fell upon Ye Qingyu.
