Chapter 285:


Chapter 285, Still alive.

The strong young leaders of the Three Schools and Three Sects that were not willing to live in seclusion had painstakingly planned this martial arts grand event. They hoped to use this opportunity to voice the opinions of the sects, to promote the status of their sect in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, and build the reputation that they believe they deserved in the kingdom. But they had no idea that they would become a paving stone for another person.

After the battle of Proud Sky Center, the legend of [The Leaf of Youyan] was born. He soared to the heavens. With his [Little Shang sword] and a moonlight silver aura, he fought until he became a legend in Jianghu.

The prestige of the Empire and the military would undoubtedly grow even further.

In the world of martial arts in Heaven Wasteland Domain, the decline of the sects seemed to be irreversible.

No matter how unwilling the people of Jianghu were, everything could no longer be reversed.

In the Xian Pavilion belonging to the Deer Cauldron Sect, there was a flicker in Wang Yifung’s eyes.

But it faded eventually.

He sat back down slowly, without saying anything.

The Deer Cauldron Sect had gotten involved in the incident within Youyan Pass, but fortunately for them their participation was not very deep. There were several times where they had been used by Zhao Shanhe and Li Qiushui, which made Wang Yifung furious. He still felt somewhat fearful and apprehensive even now.

But he was also well aware that, no matter what he did, enmity had definitely developed between Ye Qingyu and him.

When Ye Qingyu was in critical danger, he had stopped [Pill God of Snow Country] from helping Ye Qingyu. At that moment, there was already no way of fixing their relationship.

There was a flicker of fear within the eyes of Quan Zhendong of the Setting Sun and Great River Sect.

His father Quan Jiulong also remained silent.

Like the Deer Cauldron Sect, as one of the Three Schools and Three Sects, the Setting Sun and Great River Sect had also became involved in this incident. Furthermore, they previously had a lot of conflict with the military. But at least they did not really participate in the incident of the abandoned training camp, so it was not considered an unforgivable sin.

At least this time, the Deer Cauldron Sect did not need to directly face Ye Qingyu and the fangs of the Youyan army.

On the other side stood Qin Zhishui of the Unparalleled Sword City. With his pair of eyes flashing, he had a blazing intention to do battle. Clasping a slender scimitar, he firmly fixed his stare on Ye Qingyu, an indistinct intent to fight against him.

The Unparalleled Sword City had always been hidden in isolation, they had very little contact with the other Three Schools and Three Sects and possessed very few disciples. They walked a solitary path where they would only pass on their teachings to one successor. Therefore, the Unparalleled Sword City did not get involved in the chaos of Youyan Pass.

Qin Zhishui himself was a famous sword crazy martial maniac. The thing he most enjoyed doing was challenging high-level geniuses.

Evidently, Ye Qingyu’s stunning performance today had made Qin Zhishui develop a great interest in him.

However, he eventually restrained his battle intent. He was a martial maniac, but Qin Zhishui was not a fool. If he challenged Ye Qingyu at this time, it would be the same as becoming sworn enemies with him.

The surroundings of Bright Moon Lake was blanketed by a deathly stillness.

The affairs of Jianghu, should be settled in Jianghu.

But who would have guessed that it would be settled like so.

Ye Qingyu used Jianghu’s own methods to resolve the great waves of Youyan Pass.

As such, even the most militant people had nothing to say.

The events that happened in Proud Sky Center would be spread far and wide at the fastest rate. [The Leaf of Youyan] would be known worldwide. The inconceivable achievements of killing Zhao Shanhe and forcing Li Qiushiu to commit suicide would make the Jianghu of the entire Empire tremble with fear.

A new hero of the generation... has been born.

There was no doubt that [The Leaf of Youyan] and the name Ye Qingyu would become the mightiest figure that no one dared to approach in the Jianghu of Snow Empire in the future and for a very long period of time after that.

“I’m sorry to have disturbed you, I will return the arena to you. If there are any other issues, you can just resolve it by yourself, I don’t have any objection. I just hope that after the end of this meeting, you can restrain yourself within Youyan Pass. If someone is willing to assist the military in launching an attack against the Demon Race, then I greatly welcome you on behalf of the Youyan army. If someone does not want to, then equally the Youyan army will not force you to do so.” Ye Qingyu stared downwards at the spectators, his tone gentler than before. “Please do not interfere in the affairs of the army. If someone dares to follow in the footsteps of Zhao Shanhe and Li Qiushui, then don’t blame my sword for being ruthless.”

No one dared to say anything.

After what had happened today, it was likely that not even a single person of Jianghu would dare mess around in Youyan Pass. Even Li Qiushui and Zhao Shanhe had been killed, and no one could say they were better than these two people no matter whether it was in background, ability, status, or cultivation. Furthermore, the military had revealed an even more mysterious power today. Even the ancestor of the Dragon Tiger Sect had been frightened away by a few of her words; the thought of it was scary enough.

“Oh, yes, I almost forgot about you people.”

As Ye Qingyu spoke, he flicked his fingers in the air.

Dozens of silver shards of light glistened as they shot out from his fingertips, sinking into Bright Moon Lake.

Upon seeing this, everyone looked puzzled, not understanding what he meant.

On the crystal clear water surface there were ripples and the sparkling reflection of sunlight. It was completely still for miles.

While the crowd stood there astounded, the water suddenly rippled and a multitude of black bubbles came to the surface. It was a person’s head, hair dishevelled, sputtering as he broke the surface and spouting out a jet of water, choking...

A living person?

“Cough cough... I’m choking, it’s so cold, is this hell? Hey?”

It was a tall burly young man. As he floated to the surface, he suddenly leapt up. A layer of thin ice was frosted over his body. His strength was not weak at all. He hovered in mid-air, looking extremely confused. He scanned around, realizing that he was back in Bright Moon Lake, completely surprised.

“It’s him?”

“Still alive?”

“Isn’t he dead? This...”

Among the crowd by the lake, someone immediately recognized the young man.

The next instant, a huge splash came out of the lake.

A few other human figures burst up and out of the lake, coughing and leaping out of the water.

“It’s the [Metal Pen Judge], Zhang Xianlin?”

“[Scholar] Chenfei!”

“And... is that the [Three Ghosts of Bitter River]?”

“These people did not die? When Ye Qingyu made his move... he just kept them frozen? He did not kill them?”

“What about Gao Han? Could it be [The Fisherman of Han River], Hero Gao Han, is also not dead?”

Before the voices died away.

Bang!

A jet of liquid shot into the sky.

Clad in a conical bamboo hat and riding on the spout of water shooting up, Gao Han leapt into the air. Clasping his fishing rod in one hand, he made a defensive stance. He looked slightly exhausted, but his strength was still there. While suspended in mid-air, his eyes panned the area and around the crowd, instantly understanding the situation.

“I see... Thank you Marquis Ye, for your mercy.”

After a stunned moment, Gao Han finally understood. With a wry smile, he clasped his hands, showing his gratitude and respect.

Ye Qingyu smiled faintly with a nod.

“I already know about Senior Gao’s difficult situation. Thank you for your kindness on the arena. Half an hour ago, outside Proud Sky Center, the Youyan army destroyed a secret prison of the Crepe Myrtle Sect and rescued a young man called Xiao Buliu. I believe you know him?”

There was a little silver dragon situation on Ye Qingyu’s shoulder.

Ye Qingyu had already known what happened outside Proud Sky Center, apart from the fact that Bai Yuanxing was injured. Wen Wan was worried that such news would affect Ye Qingyu’s battle on the arena, so he had told Little Silver to keep it a secret for now.

“What, did you really find Buliu?”

Goa Han’s body shook and his face lit up with joy.

After he calmed slightly, he sincerely clasped his hands in gratitude again. “Marquis Ye is a moral man. I am eternally grateful. I am ashamed of what occurred today...”

When Gao Han travelled around Jianghu in the past, he became well known. He was daring and full of vigour. The compliments he received unavoidably boosted his ego and he committed a grave error as a result of this. Because of a misunderstanding that was instigated by evil people, he mistakenly killed the parents of Xiao Buliu. This caused him a lifetime of regret.

Gao Han was too ashamed of what he had done so he lived in seclusion in the Han River. He voluntarily became a ferryman and did not involve himself in the affairs of Jianghu. But the people he killed had a son called Xiao Buliu, and without his parents' care, Xiao Buliu was unable to become a hero well-known in Jianghu. He instead became a gangster. Gao Han had guilt plaguing his heart, so he secretly took care of Xiao Buliu time and time again. He often made offers to accept him as his disciple but he was refused every time. And so, Gao Han secretly helped him, hoping to preserve the bloodline of the Xiao family.

This time, the Crepe Myrtle Sect had used Xiao Buliu as a hostage. They threatened Gao Han to come to Youyan Pass, and to do what he did not want to do.

If he had killed Ye Qingyu on the arena, then he would have had to atone for his crime through his death.

It was just that he did not imagine that Ye Qingyu would be so strong and lost unexpectedly. He had no idea that the Youyan Army had accidentally rescued Xiao Buliu, who was caught as a hostage. This to Gao Han was a pleasant surprise, the perfect ending that he absolutely dared not to think of.

At this moment, the [Three Ghosts of Bitter River] finally came over.

“Hero Gao, you’re still alive, this is too great!”

“Master, you’re still alive. I’m so happy...”

Several people were ecstatic, crowding around Gao Han, feeling like they were in a dream.

“You people have really made me worried...” After Gao Han found out what had happened, he was even more grateful, but he was also angry. He turned to Ye Qingyu to express his gratitude, saying sincerely, “Thank you Marquis Ye for having mercy on me, these juniors do not know about the painstaking efforts of Marquis Ye, and offended Marquis Ye. Please forgive us.”

“Zhang Xianlin is apologizing to Marquis Ye!”

“Such an exceptional person is apologizing!”

“The [Three Ghosts of Bitter River] are apologizing to Marquis Ye.”

They all knelt down, their faces red with shame.

Previously, they had unleashed a torrent of abuse at Ye Qingyu. But who would have guessed that he was so merciful and even helped Gao Han escape from his predicament. Thinking back to the situation now, they did not distinguish between right and wrong at all. This completely was an example of people being less intelligent the longer they’ve been within the Jianghu.

“Get up, I don’t blame you. I appreciate everyone’s loyalty and righteousness. Haha, if not for your close cooperation, how could we execute Zhao Shanhe and Li Qiushiu.” Ye Qingyu laughed.

In truth, he had appreciation for such people

In the wilderness of Jianghu, there was a mix of good and bad people.

The people of Jianghu were not all ambitious, sinister people. The disciples of the sect would be forced to do something against their consciences because of the overarching interests of the sect.There was not much difference in the style and conduct of major sects from a bureaucracy; however, many of the vagabond martial artists in Jianghu were hot-blooded and fearless. Such so-called righteousness was mostly possessed by people who were of the lower class. In this aspect, Li Qiushui and Zhao Shanhe, important figures of this generation, could not even be compared to the [Three Ghosts of the Bitter River].

Ye Qingyu felt his strength and the inner yuan of his body rapidly weakening.

The three limits of the [Limitless Divine Way] had completely faded.

“If elder wants to see Xiao Buliu, you can come with me,” Ye Qingyu said with clasped hands as he regarded Gao Han and the others. His body transformed into a stream of light and directly departed from Proud Sky Center.

Such an event had finally settled.

The greatest outcome of this martial meeting has been achieved, The rest of the proceedings held no appeal to Ye Qingyu; these were things such as business deals. This was the event that merchant companies, financial organizations and powerful families would be most interested in. The Three Schools and Three Sects have experienced such a big blow so it was unlikely they would be in a mood to participate.

Gao Han and the others immediately followed behind Ye Qingyu, leaving Proud Sky Center—

========================================

Chapter 286:


After Ye Qingyu and the others left, the Proud Sky Center gradually became more and more alive.
The martial alliance meeting, according to what was first advertized, was estimated to be held for three days.
Apart from the challenges of the arena, there were still large amounts of mercantile activities still to be concluded. Li Qiushui, Zhao Shanhe and the others wanted to completely demonstrate the authority of the sects in the challenges of the arena. Afterwards, the sects would become the leader and control the whole alliance. But before the first afternoon of the day had even finished, all the dreams of the sects were completely crushed.
Right now, there wasnearly complete numbness in the minds of everyone from the sects.
The power that Ye Qingyu exhibited had fiercely broken the belief the sects had towards their own power.
In the past hundred years, although the Snow Empire had founded their own dynasty and the power of the army were throughout the lands, but the people of the sects were still immersed in the dreams of their personal martial strength. In the hearts of everyone in the Jianghu, the existence of the rule, “The matters of Jianghu should be settled in the Jianghu’ created a sense of superiority and formed a belief that they were separated from the control of the Empire’s laws. They thought they were not bounded by the rules whatsoever and they were completely immersed in such a lofty position.
The Snow Empire was powerful, but the people of the Jianghu were not under their control.
Perhaps this was the truest and most honest thought of many people from the Jianghu.
But the battles on the Arena of Life and Death today had completely crushed their sense of superiority.
This happened especially during Ye Qingyu’s merciless and piercing tirade. Like a razor blade, it had cut apart all the defences in the hearts of the Jianghu people. The most straightforward and brutal way was used to destroy their sense of superiority. They originally wanted to refute such accusations, but they increasingly discovered their words were so useless and powerless in front of Ye Qingyu.
“So Gao Han and the others did not die…”
“Marquis Ye really showed mercy…”
“In truth… when comparing the two parties, this Ye Qingyu really can’t be counted as a butcher. At least he is open and upright, and acts truly to his emotions. If the matters are true about Zhao Shanhe and Li Qiushui, then their methods may really be too underhanded!”
“The matters today, really… are out of our expectations.”
“So this was the truth behind the recent chaos in Youyan Pass.”“
“To inject demonic poison into the bodies of innocent people and turn them into demons. And then to capture them and force them onto the Beheading Demon Platforms to scam the bounties of the Empire. Such actions, are really despicable.”
“The Three Sects and Three Schools? Haha, such a way of doing things is really too sinister.”
After remaining silent, the crowd began discussing events.
There were many matters that you would only believe as the truth if you see it with your own eyes and begin to think for yourself.
The people of the Jianghu who were able to survive until now were not idiots. At the beginning, they were from the opposing party so they would obviously be somewhat biased. But after they saw these matters, they began to realize that the people and forces on their own side were that kind of people. They could not help but reflect on such matters.
This was especially so when they discovered that Gao Han and the others had not died. Such a scene was too shocking for them.
Ye Qingyu was not as bloodthirsty as the rumours say. At least he would show mercy to those truly righteous heroes. There were many people of the Jianghu who suddenly felt that perhaps they should not really become enemies of [The Leaf of Youyan] and the entire Youyan army.
If they were really like Gao Han and the others and did things according to morality and the rules, perhaps they would be accepted by the Youyan army?
There were many people that became hesitant.
The Water Ray Arena on the Bright Moon Lake was quickly repaired.
The battles would still continue.
Grudges still had to be settled.
But there was not too great of an interest on this anymore.
The mercantile transactions between the surrounding organizations had begun. The large merchant companies and financial organization could finally participate in their long awaited event.
There was no longer anyone in the number one Xian Pavilion.
The successor of the War God, Ye Congyun had departed.
The [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing, the little scholar boy Xing’er and that mysterious and unfathomable white dressed scholar had left.
And in the other Xian Pavilions, the young leaders and old elders of the tops sects evidently did not have the face to stay in Proud Sky Center after experiencing such matters. They all departed.
For them, such financial transactions already had no meaning.
For such a genius like Ye Qingyu to be born from the Empire; his wings were fully formed and he soared in the heavens. In one battle, he had completely transformed the situation that the sects had painstakingly cultivated for the last fifty years into a popped bubble. This was the most important matter. Especially the disdain and amenity that Ye Qingyu had displayed towards the sects. For all the sects of Jianghu, this was an exceedingly important information that needed to be passed on.
If such a peerless person forever held such an attitude towards the sects of the Jianghu, even the top sects needed to find a way to deal with him.
The strategists within the sects would definitely evaluate and consider the information exhibited within this battle.
Whether Ye Qingyu’s forcefulness also represented the attitude of the Empire was also something they needed to consider.
That mysterious scholar who had scared away the old ancestor of the Crepe Myrtle Sect with a sentence, evidently was someone from the Empire.
The information contained from all their actions was enough to make many sects troubled.
The [Pill God of Snow Country], Dugu Quan situated in the number nine Xian Pavilion was in an exceedingly good mood. He walked out of the pavilion with a wide grin, bringing alongside him his two grandsons as well as Song Jiannan and Song Qingluo. He casually walked around the merchant areas of the Proud Sky Center and would often exchange a few words with some familiar people.
Dugu Quan’s status was exceedingly high and his official position was also greatly respected. He became the focal point anywhere he went. There were many people who felt greatly honoured to even exchange a few words with the Pill God. After the higher ups of the great sects and Ye Qingyu left, the [Pill God of Snow Country] became the center of the crowd.
The Dugu Tianxin who was raised as the next successor for the Dugu Organization, under the introduction of the old Pill God, was able to make friends with the leaders and managers of the large organizations. He performed very well and was very eye-catching. His demeanor was both elegant and well-mannered, and obtained many people’s approval.
As for the hedonistic Dugu Dixiu, he willingly blended in the background to exhibit his brother’s excellence even more. He would just occasionally have a word or two of discussion with Song Qingluo, worried that they would neglect this young girl.
The others who saw this thought that she was Dugu Dixiu’s female companion, so they were also respectful towards her.
The Song Qingluo right now had a feeling where she was within the clouds and mists. She felt the same as if she was stepping on the clouds; there was a sensation that the ground she was stepping on was not real at all.
When Ye Qingyu’s sword broke through the heavens and sliced apart the arena, Song Qingluo had already lost the ability of the thought.
The white-clothed figure in the skies had never seemed as far away as he did before.
In that instant, this beautiful girl suddenly understood, that her previous fellow student was no longer someone of the same world as her.
He was high up and above, mysterious and excellent. He was so prodigious that one could not regard him directly.
And herself?
Apart from a good looking outer shell, there was nothing at all that she had that could compare to that youth.
She remembered the time at White Deer Academy, when she had intentionally wanted to distance herself from Ye Qingyu. And how she had forcefully requested Ye Qingyu to stay away from Song Xiaojun. Just how laughable was she?
And thinking of the evaluation of Han Shuangfu, Bai Yuqing, and the others, and how they had made things difficult for Ye Qingyu, just how childish were they?
And that young girl called Jiang Xiaohan. She was once the childhood playmate of Ye Qingyu, but she had no eye for quality at all. Because of short term gain, she made things extremely difficult for Ye Qingyu in secret. For such an ambitious girl, if she knew everything that had happened in Proud Sky Center today, would she be crying with regret?
By the side, Song Jiannan was smilingly interacting with the people from all sorts of large organisations.
The Song Jiannan who was from a merchant background was exceedingly well-equipped to handle such situations. Borrowing the status of the Dugu Organization, others also gave him face. He laughed and smiled, and the Song Jiannan who recently had always been worried and haggard seemed as if he was in his prime.
Song Qingluo bitterly smiled in her heart.
Without Ye Qingyu, perhaps the Song family would already have been over?
Ye Qingyu had never overtly said anything about such a matter. Because she was once Ye Qingyu’s classmate, they had ascended to the heavens in one step. Her father’s current glory, when compared to the authority of Ye Qingyu, was so illusionary that it was not real. Without basis at all, it was so far away from reality.
The events of the past kept flashing constantly in Song Qingluo’s head.
Her entire person seemed somewhat distracted.
……
……
“What happened?”
Ye Qingyu’s face was ugly to behold.
Bai Yuanxing lay on the bed, his eyes covered with a white cloth. Li Shizen had already made some preliminary treatments, but the injuries caused by the space thunder was something a normal doctor could not heal. There would constantly be blood seeping out. The White Horse youth was currently in a deep state of unconsciousness.
Jin Ling’er was sleeping by the bedside.
Wen Wan’s face was also ugly to look at, somewhat embarrassed and guilty, “I was too careless.”
The [South West Robber King] had switched to a clean pair of clothing. He would occasionally curiously evaluate Ye Qingyu. At this time, he already understood that the handsome young man that seemed exceedingly young was a truly important person. And that bearded and muscular man that was so strong it was ridiculous, was the subordinate of that white-clothed youth.
So this was the rumoured Marquis Ye.
He was somewhat different from his imagination.
Outside the tent, [The Fisherman of Han River] and the others waited patiently.
“The wound has already been treated. But the injury is greater than imagined. Normal medicine has no effect. The eyes of this child most likely can’t be saved, in the future…” Li Shizen let out a sigh, feeling sympathetic for Bai Yuanxing’s situation. He was under twenty and followed beside Ye Qingyu. He originally had an unlimited future, but his eyesight was ruined.
His eyes can’t be saved?
As Ye Qingyu heard this, apart from feeling stunned, there was sadness uncontrollably welling up within him.
Why was it like this?
Did Little Silver not say everything went well?
Then why would Bai Yuanxing suffer such heavy injuries.
But seeing the state of Jin Ling’er and Wen Wan, Ye Qingyu knew that he could not blame them.
“Grandfather Li, are there any other ways?” Ye Qingyu asked, recovering.
Li Shizen shook his head with a sigh.
Ye Qingyu fell silent. He suddenly thought of something, a hope rising in his heart. Turning around, “Old Wen, quickly invite brother Dugu to come here. Perhaps he will have a way.”
Wen Wan eyes brightened.
That’s right.
Dugu Quan was the [Pill God of Snow Country]. Perhaps there was some kind of medicine that could help.
Answering, Wen Wan quickly departed.
Ye Qingyu held Bai Yuanxing’s wrist in his hands, his yuan qi entering into the body of the youth to detect the state of his injuries.
After Ye Qingyu and the others left, the Proud Sky Center gradually became more and more alive.
The martial alliance meeting, according to what was first advertized, was estimated to be held for three days.
Apart from the challenges of the arena, there were still large amounts of mercantile activities still to be concluded.

“What happened?”
Ye Qingyu’s face was ugly to behold.
Bai Yuanxing lay on the bed, his eyes covered with a white cloth. Li Shizen had already made some preliminary treatments, but the injuries caused by the space thunder was something a normal doctor could not heal. There would constantly be blood seeping out. The White Horse youth was currently in a deep state of unconsciousness.
Jin Ling’er was sleeping by the bedside.
Wen Wan’s face was also ugly to look at, somewhat embarrassed and guilty, “I was too careless.”
The [South West Robber King] had switched to a clean pair of clothing. He would occasionally curiously evaluate Ye Qingyu. At this time, he already understood that the handsome young man that seemed exceedingly young was a truly important person. And that bearded and muscular man that was so strong it was ridiculous, was the subordinate of that white-clothed youth.
So this was the rumoured Marquis Ye.
He was somewhat different from his imagination.
Outside the tent, [The Fisherman of Han River] and the others waited patiently.
“The wound has already been treated. But the injury is greater than imagined. Normal medicine has no effect. The eyes of this child most likely can’t be saved, in the future…” Li Shizen let out a sigh, feeling sympathetic for Bai Yuanxing’s situation. He was under twenty and followed beside Ye Qingyu. He originally had an unlimited future, but his eyesight was ruined.
His eyes can’t be saved?
As Ye Qingyu heard this, apart from feeling stunned, there was sadness uncontrollably welling up within him.
Why was it like this?
Did Little Silver not say everything went well?
Then why would Bai Yuanxing suffer such heavy injuries.
But seeing the state of Jin Ling’er and Wen Wan, Ye Qingyu knew that he could not blame them.
“Grandfather Li, are there any other ways?” Ye Qingyu asked, recovering.
Li Shizen shook his head with a sigh.
Ye Qingyu fell silent. He suddenly thought of something, a hope rising in his heart. Turning around, “Old Wen, quickly invite brother Dugu to come here. Perhaps he will have a way.”
Wen Wan eyes brightened.
That’s right.
Dugu Quan was the [Pill God of Snow Country]. Perhaps there was some kind of medicine that could help.
Answering, Wen Wan quickly departed.
Ye Qingyu held Bai Yuanxing’s wrist in his hands, his yuan qi entering into the body of the youth to detect the state of his injuries.

Chapter 287:


287 - Your friend is not simple

Ye Qingyu's hopes of treating Bai Yuanxing all rested on the [Pill God of Snow Empire], Dugu Quan's shoulders.

But the result made him disappointed.

According to what Dugu Quan had said, those space thunder fragments were exceedingly sinister. It had the destructive power of space. If there were any injuries caused by it, treasure class medicinal pills needed to be used for there to be any possibility of recovery. But it was too late now. The space thunder fragments had already completely destroyed the pair of eyeballs within Bai Yuanxing. Even his brain had received some damage. It was utterly impossible for him to recover his eyesight.

It was not only that his eyesight could not recover, even Bai Yuanxing's normal lifestyle would be affected.

"I've already done my best. Whether this child can survive will depend on himself and fate. if his will is strong enough, and he can withstand for ten more days, then perhaps he can survive. if he cant, then..." Dugu Quan shook his head with a sigh.

He could tell that Ye Qingyu regarded this youth with mediocre talent importantly, so he had done his utmost.

"It's that serious?" Ye Qingyu's mood was heavy. "Thank you brother."

"What are you saying, you don't have to be polite with me." Dugu Quan fell silent for a brief moment. "How about this, I'll go back to the Capital today and find several of my old friends. There are specialists among them. I have an old friend called Ouyang Buping, and he specializes in the medicinal arts. Perhaps he will have a way.”

Ye Qingyu's eye brightened. "Could it be that it is the Ouyang Buping who is known as the [White Browed Divine Doctor]?"

"Haha, it's namely that old bastard." Dugu Quan smiled. "You've heard of his name?"

"It's rumoured that elder [White Browed Divine Doctor] has the power to bring people back from the dead. His medical arts have already stepped into the stage of the divine. There is no one that has not heard of his fame within the boundaries of Snow Empire."Ye Qingyu did not refuse anymore, saying, "Then thank you brother for making such a trip."

"You little kid, you don't need to be so polite with me," Dugu Quan said with a somewhat angry tone. "We are brothers, there's no need to worry about the hassle. The matters in Youyan Pass are settled and the matters regarding the Dugu family will be taken care of by my two grandsons. You just wait here patiently. I will definitely bring Ouyang Buping, that old thing back. At the most it will take ten days!"

As he said this, Dugu Quan bid his farewell, heading to the Capital.

Ye Qingyu saw him away from the Vanguard camp, then returned.

"Little Ye, it's my..." Wen Wan came over with a guilty face, his head lowered as he came over, a complete picture of someone who had done something wrong.

Ye Qingyu was exasperated by him. Shaking his head, "It's fine, I'll count this as one of the crimes of the Dragon Tiger Sect. One day, they will definitely pay for this... Oh that's right, you were once my teacher so stop pretending. if others saw it, they might accuse me of not respecting my teacher."

"That's more like it." Wen Wan began grinning. "That's right, what do you plan to do after? The White Horse tower is destroyed, so most likely you will have to temporarily remain in the Vanguard.“

Ye Qingyu looked at the sunset in the West.

The Pass and the snowy peaks, under the illumination of the sunlight, was like it were gilded. It was absolutely beautiful and filled with an aura of mystery.

After falling silent for a moment, he opened his mouth, "The urgent matter right now is to treat Yuanxing's injuries. As for other matters... After the martial alliance, I do not have any other affairs that concern me for the time being. The [War God of Youyan Pass] should be pulling the net in right now. Everything will become ordered again, and I am not suitable for making the Jianghu people stand in line. This time, I have gained greatly from the battles between Zhao Shanhe and Li Qiushui. I have to remain in isolation and cultivate, to solidify my gains. As for the spring time offence of the Youyan army, it should begin a month later. At that time, the entire army will be mobilized. Me and you, we are both people of the Vanguard, so we naturally have to follow them out on their expedition."

Wen Wan nodded his head, and said in a rare serious moment, "That's right, you are a violent person so you're suitable for violent tasks. If we made you do the task of making them stand in line, this is tantamount to killing you. I heard that when you were in Deer City, you handed over the entire matter of the Ye Household to a young servant."

Ye Qingyu smiled when he heard this.

Although the way Wen Wan described it was a little hard to hear, but he was completely right.

"That's right, how do you plan to handle Gao Han and the others?" Wen Wan gave him a winking smile. "I feel, we should accept them under our wing with such an opportunity. This is especially so for Gao Han. His martial talent is extremely high, and his personality and mentality are all top grade. If we keep him by our side, he will definitely be of great assistance."

Ye Qingyu gave a warning glance to Mad Tiger Wen, and said, "How could you care about benefits so much?"

"You little brat, you don't recognize my good intentions," Wen Wan said in frustration. "I only do this because of you. The Jianghu is massive and the world is immense. It is hard to succeed alone in this world. Even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of the Human Race, needed countless followers so they could step towards the absolutely pinnacle. It is hard to support everything with just a single pole of wood."

Ye Qingyu nodded his head without saying anything.

……

……

In the next couple of days, Youyan Pass was fairly quiet.

The Proud Sky Center and martial meeting had ended two days ago, but the resounding effects it had towards Snow Empire would slowly become evident.

For the Empire, they could be said to have been completely satisfied by this martial meeting.

For the sects, it was a scenario where they could not steal the chicken but also lost the grain used to bait the chicken. It was said that on the rankings of the young generation of the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland Domain, [The Leaf of Youyan], Ye Qingyu's name, jumped from an unknown number to number eight. This was really too shocking.

The martial scene of the Empire, in this period of time, kept discussing Ye Qingyu’s deeds.

There were countless young geniuses of the sects that swore they wanted to challenge Ye Qingyu and regain the might of the Jianghu.

Even some supreme forces of the Empire, and even the Imperial family began to regard the young man called [The Leaf of Youyan] seriously. The birth of a supreme genius of the martial way had significant meaning for many people.

From the rumours coming out of the capital, Ye Qingyu was seen as the opportunity that would break apart the exquisite balance of the Empire.

Hidden currents began surging in all directions.

10 years of strenuous study and became famous throughout the world through the Imperial examinations.

Such tales did not only describe the civil officers of the Empire, it could also be applied to the Jianghu.

In such a bustling large environment, Ye Qingyu remained separate and rarely went out. He erected a large tent within the grounds of the Vanguard, and apart from checking on the unconscious Bai Yuanxing every day, he spent a large majority of time cultivating in isolation.

Mother Wu and her children followed him within the army, so they could more conveniently take care of Bai Yuanxing.

Jin Ling'er also became much more mature.

Perhaps he had been greatly shocked, but this little fellow began training in his martial arts with bitter effort. He had gone in search of Ye Qingyu several times, requesting that he wanted to cultivate in the [Flowing Shadow Kill] cultivation technique, he did not need to consider any further. His mother Huang Zhen also agreed with the decision of her son.

Thankfully, with the considerate company of Li Qi and Li Ying, Jin Ling'er did not dwell on this matter too greatly.

As for Gao Han, the Three Ghosts Of the Bitter River and the others, they also willingly stayed behind to follow Ye Qingyu.

Gao Han, because of the gratefulness he felt when Ye Qingyu provided his assistance and mercy, had asked to stay behind. Even the [South West Robber King] Xiao Buliu had asked to remain, wanting to follow beside Ye Qingyu.

As for his reason...

"The old bastard Gao Han is here, so I of course have to follow him. I have to find an opportunity, and take revenge for my parents," the Robber King said with a completely serious face.

This reason.

Ye Qingyu accepted.

In truth, after this matter, Xiao Buliu naturally knew that Gao Han nearly died because he wanted to find some way to right the wrong. In truth, his desire for vengeance had already grown faint, but there was a knot in his heart that could not be undone.

His mind was extremely nimble. After the battle at Proud Sky Center, there were many people that wanted to follow Ye Qingyu. Since there was such an opportunity now, he would definitely not let it pass by.

In this period of time, the Youyan Pass was under the process of incorporating the people of the Jianghu. The transformation of the Youyan army was extremely successful.

For Gao Han and the others to be given an official military post, only a word needed to be said.

After Wen Wan's proposal, Gao Han and the others were successfully allocated to the military post of the White Horse tower. They can be counted as Ye Qingyu's private subordinates.

In these ten days, Ye Qingyu was constantly in a high state of anxiousness as he inspected Bai Yuanxing's wounds. Every days he would insert pure and precious yuan power into his body to help him extend his life and keep his blood flowing. But it was a pity that Bai Yuanxing did not wake up.

On the tenth day, Dugu Quan brought the [White Browed Divine Doctor], Ouyang Buping.

"The will of this child is shocking. to think he would be able to endure for so long." Ouyang Buping had completely white hair, like a young man with a childish face. He seemed to be extremely amiable, with a slight smile always on his face. After inspecting Bai Yuanxing's wounds, he seemed to have discovered something. With slight shock, "Eh? Such a method... who was it that previously treated this child's wounds?"

Ye Qingyu was taken aback, "It's a old friend. Could it be that something is wrong?”

Ouyang Buping shook his head. "there's no issue. Marquis, your friend has extreme skill. For someone with average strength to live on after being injured by the space thunder. This is all thanks to your friend. If not for his skillful way of treating the injuries, it is most likely that the injured person would not be able to survive till today.”

"What?"

Ye Qingyu was greatly shocked as he heard this.

Bai Yuanxing's wound were treated by Li Shizen. This was something that Ye Qingyu was certain of.

But who would have thought, the great and famous [White Browed Divine Doctor] would have such an evaluation of Li Shizen. This really took Ye Qingyu by surprise.

At that instant, Ye Qingyu finally realized he had overlooked something.

For Li Shizen's medical arts to be so skillful, his background must not be as simple as he had previously thought. How could he be a simple person if he was someone that even the [White Browed Divine Doctor] complimented?

In other words, the pill formula that Li Shizen gave him did not really have a history as he described.

He even thought that the formula for the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] was something that Li Shizen had created himself. How could it be so coincidental?

"Since your friend has handled the injury, then the following matters will become much simpler. I have confidence that I will be able to make him regain consciousness after ten days." After the [White Browed Divine Doctor] had inspected Bai Yuanxing's situation, he slowly became confident.

Ye Qingyu snapped back to the situation, hurrying to say, "Then thank you elder Ouyang."

Ouyang Buping gave him a glare. "Don't be a stranger Marquis. You are sworn brothers with this immoral Dugu old bastard, then how can you be estranged with me. We are all brothers. I will be presumptous, how ‘bout you call me brother Ouyang?”

Ye Qingyu was delighted, "I would be overjoyed to do so. thank you brother Ouyang."

Ouyang Buping laughed loudly.

Chapter 288:


289 - Shocking news

"I'm a little hungry."

On Bai Yuanxing's covered face, a smile finally appeared.

There was a fragrance emitting from the pot.

Jin Ling'er quickly filled a full bowl for Bai Yuanxing.

Bai Yuanxing had one or two bites, then nodded his head, "En, it's fragrant. it seems like it's dog meat. My body is still recovering, I can't eat too much meat or fish. I'll just have the broth."

"Fine, fine, you drink some more." The big headed dog was eating, lapping his lips as he excitedly lay next to the pot of stew. After a while, he suddenly realized something and reacted. He blinked his eyes, "What? Blind kid... no, Little Bai, what did you say, it's dog meat? Could you have smelled something wrongly?"

Bai Yuanxing shook his head with a smile. "This is definitely the taste of dog meat. That's right, officer Wen said he had killed a little black dog an hour ago, this must be it's meat."

Little Nine acted as if he was struck by lightning, standing there dumbly for a few seconds, unable to process what had happened.

After a short moment.

"Ah, Wen Wan, I'll slaughter you, I'll tear your skin off..." The silly dog tragically screamed, as if he had gone crazy. He shot out like a bolt of lightning out the tent, and his enraged cry could be heard from the outside, "Ahhhh, Wen Wan, you dog killer, where are you, scram out!"

Within the tent.

Ye Qingyu laughed.

Seeing Bai Yuanxing's mood turn for the better, he could finally be less worried.

……

……

In the next few days, the military power of the Youyan army also began to be mobilized more frequently.

Military order after military order began to be sent out from the Pass Lord's Residence.

There was formation airship after formation airship that was filled with the soldiers of the Youyan Pass that headed in the direction of the Explosive Snow Glacier. This time it was not only the Vanguard, all the other major camps were also sent out. The newly created [Fury Camp] was allocated outside the Pass, and was temporarily not sent to the frontlines of the battlefield.

Such a situation was commonly seen in the last decades. Every year, when the Youyan army launched the Springtime offence season, was the time the demon race suffered the most. The Youyan army had already gotten used to everything.

In this period of time, the most important thing was what occurred to the Zhang San of the Military supply department in Youyan Pass. For some unknown reason, he was temporarily relieved of his role, and was not responsible for the supply lines of the Youyan army. It was temporarily taken over by the [Painting Saint], Liu Yuqing.

Such news only spread out in a small circle.

But the power of such news could be counted as explosive.

Who was not aware that after Zhang San had been in the Youyan Pass for so many years, his roots were as deep as a great tree. It was even rumoured that Zhang San had some deep relationship with the [War God of Youyan Pass] Lu Zhaoge. No matter what happened previously, even if the Military Supply Department committed some great wrong, the Pass Lord's Residence had never punished them before.

If it was the past Youyan Pass, apart from Lu Zhaoge, there was only the Zhang San of the Military Supply Department that was like an immovable mountain. Even the influence of the commanders of the four main camps could not be compared to Zhang San.

But who would have thought this tree of the Youyan army would fall.

Some guesses and rumours began to circulate.

Those who received the quickest news, largely guessed at something. The most reasonable explanation was that Zhang San had walked too closely with the people of the sects. He had participated in some matters, that forced Lu Zhaoge to take such a measure.

But there were still many people who did not realize the true reason behind this.

Those who truly understood the upper echelon of the Youyan army, realized the incredibility of this.

Because the errors that Zhang San had committed previously had exceeded and was more ridiculous than the matters with the sects right now. Lu Zhaoge had chosen to ignore such matters in the past. But why was it that this time, even when Zhang San had not gotten himself involved too deeply, and the whole matter was just some battle of honour between the sects and the army, that he was punished? Furthermore, because Ye Qingyu had appeared, the Youyan army won completely, so there was no need for Lu Zhaoge to be enraged.

Even Ye Qingyu felt something was strange.

But he was delighted to see such a result.

Ever since arriving in Youyan Pass, the military commander he disliked the most was definitely Zhang San. It was not only because they had conflicted over issues many times. It was because Ye Qingyu hated the way Zhang San did things. In Ye Qingyu's eyes, Zhang San was an arrogant, greedy person, the ringleader of the cliques.

On the tenth day, Ye Qingyu finally obtained what he wanted from the hands of Lu Zhaoge.

[Lotus Fire of the Black Moon].

This was one of the requests Ye Qingyu made to Lu Zhaoge when he was treating his injuries.

It was rumoured that only the Imperial family of Snow Empire possessed such a strange flame. That was why, even with the ability of Lu Zhaoge, it took such a long time for him to obtain this. From this, one could tell just how precious it was.

Such a treasure was given directly by the successor of the Youyan army, Ye Congyun.

"So this is the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] from the legends!"

Ye Qingyu looked at the starlight that was brightly flickering within the formation crystal orb. He was shocked because this light that was like a star in the night did not seem like a flame at all. It was a cross-shaped starlight, faintly flickering. Through the barrier of the crystal orb, no sense of heat could be felt whatsoever, like it was an illusion.

"This afternoon, the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] arrived to the Pass Lord's Residence. My master ordered me to deliver it over at the first instance," Ye Congyun gave his respects to Ye Qingyu. With his identity today, although his military position was not high, but he was the successor of Lu Zhaoge. Judging by the weight of his words in Youyan Pass alone, this little military officer of the Pass had more weight than even Ye Qingyu. But he deeply knew that the only reason he could become who he was today was due to Ye Qingyu's help. Furthermore, he deeply remembered what Lu Zhaoge had said. So apart from feeling grateful to Ye Qingyu, he also had respect and admiration towards him.

“Give my thanks to Pass Lord Lu.”

Ye Qingyu smiled. Although he had not seen the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] before, but he believed that with Lu Zhaoge's status and identity, he would not fool him. He stowed the crystal orb away.

"Marquis is being too courteous. This [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] is originally something that master desperately needed. That day, because of the attack of the Queen of the Unmoving City of Darkness, he was injured. He needed the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] to ensure that his wounds could recover. The Youyan army sent out desperate pleas for help to the capital to ask for assistance but such cries for assistance were blocked by the Right Minister. So this flame could not arrive in time in Youyan Pass. Thankfully, you provided your aid, otherwise..." Ye Congyun's said in a somewhat resentful tone as he mentioned the Capital. "Afterwards, when master's wounds healed, we needed to send more people to chase up on the progress of this flame. Only then could we obtain the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon]. I hope this delay has not interfered with your business."

"Oh, so it was like this?" Ye Qingyu finally realized something.

At this moment, he finally understood what the ‘transaction’ they were referring to meant in that battle between Song Xiaojun and Lu Zhaoge. This was the reason why Song Xiaojun stayed within Youyan Pass, it was because there was perhaps the existence of the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] within the Pass Lord's Residence.

That day, Song Xiaojun had cooperated with Yan Buhui to ambush Lu Zhaoge. This was not to really kill Lu Zhaoge, but to injure the [War God of Youyan Pass]. It forced Lu Zhaoge to request for the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] to treat his wounds from the Imperial family of Snow Empire. As long as the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] arrived in Youyan Pass, then she and Xian'er could steal away the Lotus Fire.

Perhaps even Yan Buhui that day did not really want to kill Lu Zhaoge?

Many questions and suspicions that were always within his heart began to spread out.

After all, if she wanted to obtain the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon], it would be easier to obtain it in the Youyan Pass compared to the Capital that was strictly guarded, with as many experts as the clouds.

But just what was Song Xiaojun's objective in obtaining the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon]?

Evidently, it was very important for her. That was why she did not care about making the entire Youyan Pass or even the entire Empire as her enemy, that she would even ambush Lu Zhaoge

"That's right, my master told me to pass on this message to you. Perhaps in a few days, Marquis, you will receive an order coming from the capital. You will leave Youyan Pass and head off for the capital to take up a post there," Ye Congyun said.

"What?" Ye Qingyu was taken aback. "Head off to the capital?"

Ye Congyun nodded, saying seriously, "Perhaps because you have been in closed isolation training these days so you did not realize the news. Ever since the martial alliance meeting at Proud Sky Center, many people have begun to notice you. In truth, not only the Youyan army but the entire Imperial family was paying attention to this event. It was even said that there was some important person of the Imperial family that went personally to view this, and was exceedingly satisfied with your performance. Especially the words you said after you killed Zhao Shanhe. There is news that comes from the capital, that the Emperor wants to give you an important duty in the capital!”

So it was like this?

Ye Qingyu was greatly shocked.

Such a result had far exceeded his original plan.

To be stationed at the Capital?

To be appreciated by the Snow Emperor?

This was not within his original plans at all.

"Is such a matter believable?" Ye Qingyu asked again.

Ye Congyun replied respectfully. "if it came from the mouth of other people, then this is hard to tell. There are far too much information being spread about throughout the Jianghu or the Imperial Court. But since master told me to tell Marquis such news, then it should be true," saying this, Ye Congyun clasped his hands respectfully. "I give you my congratulations. For you to receive the appreciation of the Snow Emperor and head towards the capital, you will definitely receive an important duty. You will definitely head straight for the clouds and have a limitless future.”

Ye Qingyu shook his head. With a faint smile, he said, "If it was really like this, this may not be too great a thing. Although Youyan Pass is situated at the bitter cold borders, but you can control the entire situation within Youyan Pass. Even if there are Jianghu people being restless, they cannot cause too many waves. But the situation in the Capital is chaotic and treacherous. It is one of the most terrifying hidden killing grounds of Heaven Wasteland Domain. I am only a tiny little fourth class Marquis. If I am swept up within such currents, it is hard to tell what will happen to me."

"Your fortune is great and deep. Furthermore, you have the care of elder Dugu and elder Ouyang, so you should be fine. Master has already made some preparations, and gave some introductions to some old friends within the capital. After you enter the capital, you can go find such people." As Ye Congyun said this, he took out a letter and handed it over to Ye Qingyu.

"Oh? In other words, Pass Lord Lu agrees that I should head towards the capital?" Ye Qingyu finally captured the meaning within Ye Congyun's words.
