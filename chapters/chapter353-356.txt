Chapter 353:


354 - Human King Sword Mantra

The battle instructor let out a laugh. "Don't be happy too soon. The last examination is not that easy to pass. Once you've truly passed the true examination, the Crown Prince will personally come to the military department and bestow a weapon onto you. The cultivation technique that you will train in right now is also something that the Crown Prince bowed down in front of the pavilion of the Snow Emperor to beg for a chance to enter into the War God Hall of the Empire to obtain for you. He picked it personally from the War God Hall.”

As he said this, a row of silver armoured soldiers walked in line and spread apart behind the battle instructor.

There were namely eighteen soldiers. Each of them had a treasure jade box in their hands. There were small inscriptions at the front of every jade box, each with different names written on it. Ye Qingyu's name appeared on the fourth jade box.

"Everyone go take their cultivation mantra according to their own name."

The battle technique instructor instructed.

So the jade boxes were the cultivation techniques that were prepared for the young experts.

Ye Qingyu was deep in thought as he walked over. He uncovered the jade box with his name written on it. A faint surge of yuan qi rushed out, and inside was an one inch thick light blue threaded manuscript. The skin of the manuscript was made from beast skin. It was not a jade scroll, and seemed exceedingly simple from the outside.

Taking out the manuscript.

There were four powerful, ancient characters on the first page.

[Human King Sword Mantra]!

It was a sword mantra.

Ye Qingyu's heart was faintly shaken.

He had once heard of this sword mantra.

Previously, in the intervals between the conversation with Dugu Quan several days ago, they had once mentioned a famed person in the past of the Empire. Dugu Quan had mentioned a war god of Snow Empire that was known as a character that was unmatched throughout all of history.

According to the rumour, he was the sworn brother from another mother of the founding Snow Emperor. He had stepped into the Heaven Ascension stage at twenty years old. Not only was his personal cultivation unmatched, the way he led his army, formation arrays, smelting weapons, refining pills, zither, chess, book, arts, flowers and arts, he was unmatched. He was a genius in all aspects. There was nothing he could not do. In the past, when the Snow Empire warred on several large sects, the army led by this divine battle god was undefeatable, shaking the primordial lands of Heaven Ascension. It was said that the founding Emperor had also sighed in amazement, and said half the Empire was won in battle by this battle god of a different surname.

But it was a pity, that Heavens itself was jealous of his genius. After this unmatched wargod established the Snow Empire, he had fallen during a heavenly tribulation. He had dissolved in the Dao, and fallen in the world, with no trace of his body.

The founding Emperor had also fallen in tragedy because of him. He abdicated from his position as Emperor, disappearing from the world.

Such news was not written in proper history. Dugu Quan had once experienced such a history so had mentioned it. He had unintentionally brought up such a topic during conversation with Ye Qingyu.

Dugu Quan had also mentioned that the unmatched War God in the past of the Snow Empire, his sword cultivation had gotten to such a stage that it was peerless throughout all of history. And the most peerless sword mantra that he possessed was split into three parts. It was namely the [Human King Sword Mantra], [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra] and the [Life Sword Mantra]. According to the rumours, these three secret sword Dao techniques were known as number one throughout Heaven Wasteland Domain. Even in the age where hundreds of sects blossomed and there were even many sects that originated from ancients times, they did not possess such a peerless and unmatched sword mantra.

Ye Qingyu remembered, that when Dugu Quan had mentioned these three sword mantra, he also had a face of envy.

It was that only as the unmatched War God fell, news of the three sword mantras also disappeared.

Some people guessed, that it was kept in the martial treasury of the Imperial family.

Some people had also guessed that as the Unmatched War God failed his tribulation, the three sword Mantras also disappeared into ashes.

Ye Qingyu could be said to have cultivated in techniques of the Sword Dao. The [Four moves of the Unmatched General] that originated from the [Fiendgod Titled hart] had originally belonged to an ability of the sword arts. Because of that, Ye Qingyu was greatly interested in these three sword mantras and was saddened by their loss.

He had had never imagined that he would see in such a way, one of the three mantras, the [Human King Sword Mantra].

The military department had gifted such a class of sword mantra to himself?

This was not logical.

For such a precious sword art mantra, even the princes of the Empire could not be guaranteed to be able to study in it. And for them to just gift it to him?

Ye Qingyu found this hard to believe.

What about the other people.

Did the other people also obtain the [Human King Sword Mantra]?

Or perhaps they obtained the other two parts of the three mantras? The [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra] or the [Life Sword Mantra]?

He took a brief scan around. He saw that the pale long yellow-haired youth had a pale silver little manuscript. It was called the [Shooting Sun Projectile] and was not one of the three mantras.

The youth on the other side, had a staff. And the technique he obtained, was known as the [Facing Heaven Staff]. It was a strange name, Ye Qingyu had never heard of it before.

Ye Qingyu carefully covered the name of the [Human King Sword Mantra] in his hands, to prevent others seeing and stealthily retreated.

He could be sure that the battle technique everyone obtained was not the same. It could be suitable for the weapon that was favoured by that person. Out of the eighteen people, apart from himself, who used a sword as a weapon, there were only two other people. But it was a pity that they stood far away, and was cautious. Ye Qingyu was not able to see, whether the battle technique these two obtained were the other two parts of the three part mantra.

Very quickly, everyone had obtained their own battle techniques.

Nearly everyone opened it to have a small look at a portion. From the expressions of the young experts, everyone was fully satisfied.

"Fine, now that you have all obtained your own secret mantra, you must remember. Everyone’s secret mantra is a priceless treasure. The crown prince personally picked it for you himself. Only the prince, apart from yourselves, know what kind of battle technique has been chosen for you. You must carefully protect your mantra. One month later, you must return it. You are not allow to copy or replicate it. You are all martial experts, so I will not give advice on how to cultivate, comprehend yourself. The only area I'm responsible for is to test your progress everyday and make an evaluation towards your own strength,” the Instructor shouted loudly.

The young experts all listened seriously.

Ye Qingyu nodded his head slightly, in thought.

According to the tone of the instructor, it seemed that the training plan of these young experts was initiated by the current crown prince. There were so many areas they could not manage, but they invested so highly. Just what did they want after spending such a huge expenditure?

"When you came, you should have already obtained the name plate that belonged to yourself. There is a title on it. From today onwards, forget your name, and use the title to replace it. In the [Dragon Tiger List], on the great hall, the rankings of the tiles is the ranking of your own strength. “

As the battle instructor spoke, he pointed to the blue gold stone wall of the great wall. There was a water ripple projection on it.

There was suddenly light flickering on the screen.

Eighteen names, from top to bottom, gradually appeared.

Ye Qingyu thought back, and faintly remembered, the title on his nameplate was [War God]. At that time, he had not paid too much attention, and just treated it as words with no meaning. Now he suddenly realized that it was a title that belonged to him.

He lifted his head to look, and discovered that the title ranked number one on the screen was namely [War God].

"En? I'm ranked number one out of all these eighteen people?"

Ye Qingyu was faintly surprised, then his expression quickly calmed down.

Through the observation of these days, he could largely confirm that the others were of no threat to him. Therefore, ranking number one was not something worth being surprised or proud about.

But evidently, these young experts did not think in this way.

"Haha, [War God]?" the black robe young man snorted coldly. "To dare have a title like [War God], you really are arrogant. Who is it? Let me have a look?"

"Ranked number one? Interesting. I want to know, just how many hammer strikes can he withstand from me, [Avalanche]." The muscular two meter tall youth held the thunder hammer in his hands, his will to do battle burning in his eyes.

The title of this muscular young man, was called [Avalanche].

On the [Dragon Tiger List], [Avalanche] was ranked number six.

The person ranked number two was [Shadow].

Ranked number three was [Flowing Light].

The fourth was [Flame].

The fifth was [Storm].

Following along the list, there were all sorts of strange titles such as [Desert], [Lonely Smoke], [Long River], [Setting Sun]. The last title on the ranking was called, [Normal Person].

"Remember your ranking. Remember your identity. From today onwards, abandon everything, and focus on training. This place permits sparring and challenges, but it absolutely does not allow killing your comrade. The crown prince hopes that you will be able to trust and cooperate with each other, not hate and isolate each other. You must firmly remember this point.”

As the instructor spoke to here, his expression became serious. "Right now, report to your title. [Normal Person], come here.

As he spoke.

A youth about one meter and seventy centimeters tall took a step forward, and loudly reported his title.

This was a young man with a normal appearance. The only special attribute he had was he had a big head, which was large enough to make one shocked. The size of his head was nearly the width of his shoulders, it was as if his body could nearly not support his head. In his calm expression, there was a trace of embarrassment hidden within. Previously, he had remained silent, and Ye Qingyu had only paid an extra glance or two at this young man's head.

What follow after was that people reported to their titles.

The person ranked number two, [Shadow] was really that black-robed young man.

The person ranked number three, [Flowing Light] was the lazy young man with pale yellow hair.

[Flame] was the red long haired youth.

[Storm] was the short haired youth by the side. His body was muscular, and only second to the person ranked number six, [Avalanche].

Only until the end, when everyone's gaze focused on him, did Ye Qingyu reveal his title of [War God].

In that instant, the young experts were all disconcerted.

"Him? [War God]?"

"For this coward, to be ranked number one?"

"There must be a mistake.”

"Apart from being a little handsome, I can't see anything special."

They muttered in low voices.

There were also the undisguised sneers.

"I want to challenge you."

Chapter 354:


355 - Welcome any time

There was someone laughing.

Ye Qingyu looked at the instructor by the side.

The instructor shrugged his shoulders. "I've already said what I've had to say. The following is training time, it permits sparring between you all. Whether you want to accept his challenge or not is up to you."

In other words, he would not step in.

In truth, this technique instructor also wanted to see just what sort of battle power Ye Qingyu who was ranked number one had. For the crown prince to personally inscribe the title of [War God] to him, and for him to be ranked number one on the [Dragon Tiger List].

"What? You don't dare?" The gaze of [Shadow] was like a blade, pressuring him. "If you don't dare, then go erase your name from the ranking obediently. Don't stay here and embarrass yourself."

Thinking back to the coward-like behaviour Ye Qingyu had within the dormitory, the black-robed youth, [Shadow], had no way of accepting such a person being ranked in front of him.

There were many gazes of disdain, and people delighting in Ye Qingyu's misfortune that landed on Ye Qingyu.

Ye Qingyu thought about it, then nodded his head. "Fine.”

His figure flashed, coming to the arena in the great hall.

The instant he landed on the arena, [Shadow] had already landed opposite him.

An extremely fast speed.

Ye Qingyu's face was calmed, and stabbed the [Beheading Wind] sword in his hand into the arena. Deeply breathing in, his aura gradually gathered. He slowly let out a fist. The air rippled like a wrinkle around the fist, discernible with the naked eye. There was not any powerful sound of air exploding or light exploding along the fist, but there was the faint sound of a dragon's roar that accompanied his fist.

The speed of the fist was exceedingly slow.

The complexion of [Shadow] opposite him greatly changed.

It seemed as if Ye Qingyu's punch had no way of being avoided.

"This is [Dragon Fist]? This is the first move of the [Dragon Fist]. To think that he would have already understood to such a degree? Such a strength... is evidently... The Bitter Sea stage... he has already touched on the boundaries of the laws…”

[Shadow] was shocked. He instantly knew that he had underestimated [War God]. His appearance and actions were so unremarkable, but his strength was terrifying.

"Will I be afraid?"

His powerful pride caused [Shadow] to let out an enraged roar. The first move of the [Dragon Fist] that he had learned also exploded.

The instant the fists met.

Boom!

The entire great hall shook.

"Hai..."

Letting out a jet of blood, [Shadow] felt as if his right arm was struck by lightning. His arm instantly lost all feeling and went numb, and he could not even stand where he was anymore. Like soaring through the clouds, he flew backwards, he fell off the arena and struck against two or three weapon racks. After staggering back tens of steps, he finally used his left palm to press against the wall of the great hall to stabilize his body.

[Shadow] looked with fear and shame towards the arena.

On the arena.

Ye Qingyu took back his fist, his face calm.

The surroundings were completely silent.

"You... fine. Today, I admit my loss." [Shadow] bit his teeth, wiping away the blood at the corner of his mouth. Turning around, he entered into the dormitory by the side, going to rest and recover.

The other people also had expressions of shock as they looked at Ye Qingyu.

Previously, Ye Qingyu's performance had been unremarkable. He had even chosen to retreat in the face of provocation, causing many young experts who came from a military background to look down on him. A soldier valued pressing forward. No matter what, they would go towards a mountain with a tiger even if they knew there was a tiger. They would never compromise. From their perspective, Ye Qingyu's action was a display of weakness.

The reason he was so cowardly must be because he had no confidence in his own strength?

There were many people who thought that way.

But evidently they were all wrong.

Using one fist to defeat [Shadow] who was ranked number two. The power that he exhibited was no longer stronger, it was far too strong.

Previously, the reason [Shadow] was so arrogant and tyrannical was because he had already defeated many people within the eighteen young experts. This include the [Avalanche] who was as tall as a bear, including [Flame] and [Storm].

Until now, only the lazy youth [Flowing Light] had not exchanged pointers with [Shadow].

All the other people had unquestionably been defeated by [Shadow].

And [Shadow] had unquestionably been defeated by [War God].

This was a very simple conjecture of strength. Evidently, the others did not possess the strength to challenge [War God].

"Does anyone else want to challenge?"

Ye Qingyu stood on the arena, his expression calm as he asked such a question.

Everyone looked at each other.

After a short while, the [Avalanche] that was muscular like a gorilla finally could not endure. Holding the thunder hammers in his hands, he jumped on the arena. Letting out a smile, "I am called Zhang Lei, the deputy commander of the Vanguard of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] in the North East. Fourth Class Military Marquis. Let us have a spar."

Ye Qingyu clasped his fist. "My fortune."

After three breaths, accompanied by an earth shattering humongous bang, Zhang Lei was struck off the arena.

Both his arms could no longer be lifted up.

His thunder hammers fell on the arena.

"A great strength..." [Avalanche] yelled, blood seeping out from the joints of his finger. He had an expression of shock as he looked towards Ye Qingyu on the arena. He originally possessed herculean strength when he was born. It was said that when he was being born, thunder encircled around his body. When he was one, he could already lift fifty or so pounds of rock. When he was twenty, his arms could already lift over a hundred thousand pounds. And the cultivation technique he studied in was one that focused most on strength, [Heavenly Tremendous Strength]. Within the entire north east army, his strength was unmatched.

Even if [Shadow] struck with him directly, he was by far not enough in terms of power.

But right now, the moment the fists of the [War God] met his hammer, he had struck him from the arena in just one move, causing both his arms to be nearly crippled.

Just what sort of power was this?

"I admit defeat, I admit defeat. You are fit to bear the title of [War God]. This is the first time I, Zhang Lei, have lost to someone in terms of strength..." The gorilla-like young man yelled.

Ye Qingyu smiled, flicking his sleeve.

The two thunder hammers floated lightly through the air, landing in front of Zhang Lei, [Avalanche].

"Is there anyone else that wants to come up and try?"

Ye Qingyu was not flustered or arrogant, as he calmly asked.

The people below looked at each other. Ultimately, there was no one else that entered.

Not mentioning other aspects, just solely by power alone, no one was able to defeat [War God].

Even if others had the heart to challenge, but now was not the time. After observing for a period of time and finding out the strength and cultivation techniques of this [War God], and after they understood more, then it was not too late to act then. After winning two rounds consecutively, the aura of the [War God] was powerful, so it was not best to oppose him. If they lost, they would lose the drive in their heart and challenging him again would be even more difficult.

"Since there is no one, then I'll come down." Ye Qingyu smiled. "If there are any other brothers that want to spar, then I welcome this challenge at any time."

As he finished, he jumped down from the arena.

The complexions of all the surrounding youths were somewhat hard to look at.

His tone evidently meant that he did not place any importance towards them at all. He did not even consider them as opponents. Thinking back to the attitude everyone had and how they treated Ye Qingyu previously, this slap was really too painful.

The battle instructors heart, upon seeing this, was also incomparably shaken.

The strength that Ye Qingyu exhibited did not match the report that the military department had gathered.

After training in the [Dragon Fist] in the morning, he was able to use it in real battle in the afternoon. And he had even grasped the true essence of this technique. The [Dragon Fist] was known as the number one mantra for body refinement in the Bitter Sea stage. It's power was not solely in use for body refinement, but it also had great power in terms of battle. Bao Shinu had not mentioned this in the morning, but Ye Qingyu had already deduced this, and used it in the arena battle just now.

The comprehension of this person was really fearful.

This was the conclusion the battle instructor came to.

He left along with the eighteen soldiers.

After they left the training camp, the soldiers scattered.

The battle technique instructor walked several steps, then encountered the body refinement instructor Bao Shinu.

"How is it?" Bao Shinu had a smile that was not a smile.

"Terrifying," the battle technique instructor stated. "Eighteen young experts, every one of them are frightening. Every one of them are many times stronger than me when I was their age. When they mature, their power will be hard to estimate. Especially that Ye Qingyu. No wonder the crown prince personally gave the title of [War God] to him personally."

Bao Shinu nodded his head, "They are definitely the people that Princess Chang had personally picked. They are worth holding expectations for. But, you may have spoken slightly too much today."

The battle technique instructor was taken aback, then instantly understood Bao Shinu's meaning. Nodding his head and sighing, "With the situation today, time and tide waits for no man. There are some words that must be spoken sooner or later. These little kids, all of them are proud and arrogant. I want to make them know just who was it that prepared everything for them today, just who has invested in them to make them understand who they should be thankful to."

“You are right, but these eighteen young experts are able to kill a path for themselves out of thousands of soldiers on the battlefield. Their will must be absolute or they have prodigious talent. To truly capture their hearts, is not a simple matter. This matter is difficult, very difficult," Bao Shinu sighed as he said.

"Even if it's difficult, we still have to try bit by bit." The tone of the battle technique instructor was firm as steel.

Bao Shinu did not say anything else.

……

……

Returning to the dormitory, Ye Qingyu sat cross legged on the stone bed, resting his aura.

Obtaining the [Dragon Fist] in the morning, he had already grasped all nine movements. He believed that in less than one month, he would completely comprehend and integrate it with him, and be able to use it in true battle.

Most importantly, Ye Qingyu had discovered a new secret.

In the morning, when Bao Shinu had taught the heart sutra that related to the [Dragon Fist], there was faint ancient will hidden in it. It did not seem to be a heart sutra that belonged to the current era. Ye Qingyu had once seen such similar cultivation sutras from the [Fiendgod Titled Chart]. Most importantly, in the heart sutra Bao Shinu passed on, although it could entirely activate the body refinement effect of the [Dragon Fist], but there would be a small imperfection left behind. It would not be able to truly display the true might of the nine moves of the [Dragon Fist] mantra.

Ye Qingyu had tried tens of time, but the end result was all the same.

This meant that this was not an issue of his comprehension. It was that the heart sutra that Bao Shinu taught originally had issues.

In other words, the sutra he passed on was not complete----

========================================

Chapter 355:


356 - Rematch, [Shadow]

Because Ye Qingyu had no way of confirming whether the other young experts had discovered this, he had no way of confirming whether the technique Bao Shinu possessed was not complete, or he had intentionally hidden away the true heart of this technique. Therefore, Ye Qingyu did not raise this point.

But he constantly attempted to use the nameless breathing technique along with the [Dragon Fist] sutra. He was incomparably shocked to discover that, under his activation, the nine moves of the [Dragon Fist] were able to reach a mysterious perfect state. It caused him to feel extremely comfortable, as if he was floating in the air.

There were nine gaps and weaknesses that originally existed, but they had completely disappeared.

When he discovered this, it was something unexpected, but it seemed to be reasonable.

Previously, he had already experienced the specialness of this nameless breathing technique fully. That ancient existence that had pretended to be the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So, had once called this nameless breathing technique peerless. Furthermore, Ye Qingyu had also used the nameless breathing technique to activate other cultivation techniques before. The effects of doing such a thing had always been better than using the original breathing techniques.

On the arena, he had beaten [Shadow] and [Avalanche] namely because of this.

This had affirmed Ye Qingyu's resolve to use the nameless breathing technique to activate the [Dragon Fist] sutra.

But right now, he should do something else.

Slowly activating the nameless breathing technique, faint white mist began spreading about. It covered and enveloped Ye Qingyu's entire person as well as the stone bed below him. From outside, they could only see a silver mist and had no way of seeing what Ye Qingyu was doing on the bed.

Being careful of the eyes around him, Ye Qingyu took out the [Human King Sword Mantra].

This was what Dugu Quan had complimented as one of the three peerless sword mantras of Heaven Wasteland. Just what sort of mystery was hidden within this sword mantra?

Ye Qingyu was expectant.

He slowly opened to the first page of the sword mantra.

A swathe of small characters the size of flies met him.

Sword, the sacred item of the ancients. Respected and noble, it is worshipped by humans and deities. It is the ancestor of all weapons, the tool for killing. Deep into one's path, one can enter the Dao. Lightweight and convenient, vigorous, striking fast and nimble. A Divine weapon. The way of the sword. The first is Human, the second Deity, the third is Heaven. The sword of the Human King cannot be defeated by human. The sword of the Divine Emperor cannot be defeated by Fiendgods. The sword of Heavens is Life. The existence of the world is life. The way is split into Yin and Yang, life goes through living and dying. Life is neither dying nor living. If life and death does not exist, the way does not exist. This is the law. Without the way, there is no domain. Without domain, there is nothing. With the way, there is domain. Only with domain can sword exceed all!”

This paragraph was the introduction of the [Human King Sword Mantra].

After Ye Qingyu finished reading it, he felt as if knowledge was being forced through his head. It was as if he was amidst the clouds.

Such an introduction placed reverence for the sword arts to the extreme.

If he did not guess wrong, Ye Qingyu felt this paragraph was not only the introduction of the [Human King Sword Mantra], but it was also the introduction of the Human King, the Divine Emperor as well as the Life Sword Mantra. If the unmatched War God described by Dugu Quan had really cultivated such sword arts to the realm described by this introduction, then even in the nine heavens, the ten earths, and the three thousand domains, there would be no one who would be his opponent.

After reading to here, Ye Qingyu could not but give his respect. He became much more serious.

He placed the mantra on the bed, then respectfully bowed in front of it. After giving it the ceremony it deserved, he used the power of the [Supreme Ice Flame] to wash his hands then once again held the [Human King Sword Mantra] to have a more careful look.

Time passed slowly.

Ye Qingyu looked as if he was mad or drunk, forgetting everything around him.

Only after eight hours did he suddenly awaken.

"To think that the [Human King Sword Mantra] does not have any sword moves..."

He was dumbfounded.

This sword mantra described thousands of moves of the sword arts. Hack, chop, collapse, hinder, raise, cut, thrust, disturb, wash, press, hang, sweep and so on. It spoke about how it was flexible yet firm, and can take in and thrust out not being constrained by anything, nimble and effortless. Ultimately, it became just a sentence---

"It can be understood but not described!“

Ye Qingyu could not laugh or cry.

Just what sort of mantra was this, it seemed to be just fabrication. If not for the fact that he had heard Dugu Quan mentioning such secrets, Ye Qingyu would really have believed that the [Human King Sword Mantra] in his hands was the prank of someone. Just what sort of mantra was this? It did not mention breathing techniques, it did not mention martial moves, it did not mention the process of cultivation, but only mentioned the ultimate result?

Thankfully, the [Human King Sword Mantra] had lastly mentioned that as long as he reached a state that his sword would move with his will, and the feeling that his sword was unstoppable, then he would have succeeded.

Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Just what sort of secret mantra was this.

Ye Qingyu could only go back from the beginning and slowly mull over the meaning of the words. He tried to understand phrase from phrase. He attempted to discern some cultivation techniques from these obscure and vague worlds. Perhaps such an incredible sword mantra was not simple, and there was a secret hidden within.

……

In the next few days, everyone madly trained.

After receiving the most suitable weapon and the most perfect cultivation techniques, this was unquestionably the best thing in this entire world. Furthermore, there were unending sources of herbs, pills and Origin crystal, cultivation resources. Such things were even better and more excellent than those given to noble children of many high noble families.

They were all from a poor background and had struggled on the line between life and death. They all had a heart that yeared towards the martial arts, and everyone madly trained, racing against time.

Bao Shinu as well as that battle technique instructor would appear for a period of time everyday. But they would not give advice of their own initiative. Only when someone asked would they demonstrate to solve their queries.

Between the young experts, there were no more incidents where they sparred or challenged with each other.

Everyone was clear just how important this period of time was.

It was only that every time the black-robed young man, [Shadow], saw Ye Qingyu, he would let out a cold snort. There was still a fierce will to do battle burning in his eyes----in truth, it was not only just [Shadow]. Every young expert, when they saw Ye Qingyu, would have a fierce desire to fight. But it was only that everyone suppressed such an urge.

Because everyone understood, the current them, had no chance of defeating [War God].

The scene that appeared on the training hall which showed the rankings of the young experts, constantly changed although the extent to which it changed was not large. The rankings would move up and down by three or four places. The only reason it changed was the observation and judgement of several Bitter Sea stage instructors, as well as the results of some formations that tested their strength.

Even the ranking of [Shadow] had been exceeded by [Heavenly Projectile] once or twice.

As for the title [War God], it had always remained in number one. It had never changed.

Of course, the person that was titled [Normal Person] had always remained last. This had also never changed.

Everyday was training, training and more training.

The young experts seemed to have turned mute. Without the need, they would rarely speak. In the training camp, apart from the sound of weapon striking weapon, there were no other noises.

Every one of them had driven eyes. Either they were sitting in a meditative position on their own stone beds for an entire day, or they would train for an entire day in front of the formation machinery.

Time seemed to have lost it's meaning.

Such a situation continued until the tenth day.

"[War God], I challenge you."

The black-robed young man, [Shadow], had red eyes, as if he was a wild, crazed beast. There was a mad killing aura encircling around his body. He came before Ye Qingyu's stone bed, his voice hoarse, as if he was about to go into a frenzy.

From [Shadow]'s body, he could sniff an extremely dangerous aura.

Such danger did not represent that [Shadow] had suddenly become much stronger. It was that the aura within [Shadow]'s body was at the borderline of explosion. Evidently, he had forcefully trained in some sort of cultivation technique. If one spoke commonly, he had signs of falling into demonic disruption.

"Do you dare accept battle?" The voice of [Shadow] was like two pieces of metal grating against each other.

Such an action attracted the attention of everyone around them.

Everyone came to have a look.

It had finally arrived.

Such a day had finally arrived.

There was finally someone that willing to challenge [War God] again?

Ye Qingyu slowly stood up, nodding his head. "Fine."

Before he had finished.

The figures flickered.

[Shadow] had already appeared on the outside arena.

What also appeared on the arena at the same time was Ye Qingyu.

Xiu!

A bolt of black lightning shot from the waist of [Shadow] to Ye Qingyu.

Without wasting any words, battle instantly begun.

Such a black lightning, was namely the newly acquired weapon of [Shadow]. This black supple sword that could enwrap around his waist was like the nimble tongue of the sword. It was like lightning, extremely fast.

Ye Qingyu did not unsheathe the sword [Beheading Wind]

He took a step aside, lowering his waist and striking out with his fist. Accompanied by the roar of dragons all around, a fist struct against the body of the black-coloured soft sword.

Clang!

The sound of metal clashing sounded.

The black-coloured sword was like a shocked little snake flickering about. but the sword move was not broken. One turned to two, two turned to four, four to eight, eight into the infinite. The black shadow that enveloped the sky was like the tongues of a poisonous snakes that was accompanied by the sound of air being pierced through. It headed bitingly towards Ye Qingyu's body.

A faint cold shadow power began to be exhibited within the sword moves.

"So this [Shadow] is the same as Jin Ling'er. He is also a martial expert with the shadow attribute.”

Ye Qingyu instantly made a judgement about the martial cultivation specialities of [Shadow].

He still lowered his waist, the nameless breathing technique activated. The first move of the [Dragon Fist], second, and third unendingly struck out. The action was not urgent or slow, and seemed to be filled with a strange rhythm. The cold aura exploded, and the power of the fist rebounded, letting out a light that was filled with a serious aura.

Countless sword glimmers were struck backwards or to the side by the power of that fist. It completely had no way of nearing within three inches of Ye Qingyu.

"Hou!"

[Shadow] let out a roar like that of a wild beast. His eyes were red as if they were about to drip with blood. There was a chaotic aura that emanated around him, the black supple sword in his hands turning firm and flexible back and forth. It was a series of extremely strange swordsmanship that was exhibited by him. When it was activated to its extreme, one could only see sword shadows throughout the sky, the hum and cutting sounds of the sword unending. It was as if there were thousands of tongues of poisonous snakes spitting in the air, but you were not able to see [Shadow's] figure.

Ye Qingyu stood where he was, not moving in the slightest.

The nine moves of the [Dragon Fist] began exhibiting in his hands, not fast or slow. A vast power from his fists reverberated throughout. Dragon roar after dragon roar became clearer and clearer, the vast sound combined with the power of the fist shook people's hearts that constantly emanated from the arena.

Tens of thousands of black shadows, like an angry swelling tide, struck towards Ye Qingyu. But it had no way of invading past the area of Ye Qingyu's fist.

"Che!"

[Shadow] let out a jet of blood. There was even blood coming out from his eyes, his nostrils, and his ears. His face was as horrifying as a vicious ghost, extremely terrifying.

The black supple sword in his hands became more and more berserk.

The sword was like a black waterfall. There were scraps of yin aura contained within, as if it would turn into a stream of space time that would envelop the entire training camp. The aura was extremely berserk and did not seem to be human power at all. It was as if there was a demon that had walked out from a dark river of blood.

The people surrounding the arena gradually took steps backwards.

"He's fallen into a state of demonic fire.”

Ye Qingyu was able to see [Shadow's] state, and instantly realized what had happened.

The sword moves he showed should have been from the sword mantra he had obtained from the instructor. But from the aura of the sword, it should not be moves from the legendary [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra] or the [Life Sword Mantra]. It should be a set of sword moves that was suitable for people of the shadow attribute.

Ten days ago, [Shadow] had fallen in his hands. It must be that his pride and self-confidence had taken a large hit. In these days, he had madly trained. However he had pursued results too strongly, causing his heart to be disrupted. He was not able to truly comprehend the essence of this set of shadow sword moves, and instead caused him to fall into a state of demonic fire.

[Shadow] was not a normal person. He instantly realized this point and wanted to challenge himself. He wanted to solve this danger within battle, breaking through his bottleneck and getting rid of his psychological demon.

But it was a pity that he took the first step wrongly, so every step after that would be wrong. Right now, he activated the Shadow sword mantra with his full power, but it had instead hastened the process of his demonic fire.

Right now, all his apertures were leaking with blood. The reverse devouring of the cultivation technique was only a thought away.

"He is after all a genius of the military of our Snow Empire. Although his temper is bad, but he cannot be known as a bad person. Why don't I help him." Ye Qingyu's thoughts were like lightning. After realizing the cause and effect, he decided to give him a hand.

"Ang Ang Ang!“

The roar of dragons loudly sounded out. Ye Qingyu's body acted, it was still a move of [Dragon Fist] that struck out.

This was the first time he struck of his own initiative.

Ding!

With a light sound, the [Dragon Fist] struck the true body of the black supple sword.

With Ye Qingyu's current body refinement cultivation, just how terrifying of a power did he have. [Shadow] could not hold the shadow in his heart anymore, and the black sword was sent flying into the air. With a light sound, it pierced into the blue gold ceiling to the hilt.

[Shadow], who was at his very limits, without the sword in his hand, his aura sharply fell.

Ye Qingyu let out a fist, striking on his head.

"Don't..."

There was a loud shout below.

The battle technique instructor had arrived. He shouted as he lost his composure in fear. He did not imagine that Ye Qingyu would really strike to kill. With a flicker of his figure, he wanted to arrive at the arena to stop everything from occurring.

But a surge of power, instantly dragged his figure back.

The battle technique instructor turned around, and saw it was the body refinement instructor Bao Shinu.

"Let's have a look. [War God] is not really trying to kill him." There was strange light flickering in Bao Shinu's eyes, staring at what was occurring on the arena.

"What?" the battle technique instructor was taken aback. He instantly realized something, and there was shock in his eyes, "You mean..."

"What the [War God] is using is the [Dragon Fist]." There was both admiration and disbelief in Bao Shinu’s tone.

On the arena.

"Che!"

[Shadow] let out a jet of black blood.

The yuna qi in his body was chaotic. His body had nearly lost the ability to move. Blood dripped from every aperture in his body and seemed extremely horrifying. He stared fixedly at Ye Qingyu, and laughed, "Good, good, to be able to die in your hands is not wasted... it's a pity..."

"Focus your qi and concentrate!"

Ye Qingyu shouted. At the same time, accompanied by dragon roars, tens of fists landed on [Shadow's] body.

[Shadow] was taken aback.

He suddenly realized, that the fists of the [War God], when it struck on his body, was instantly enough to directly turn him into a pulp of meat. But after receiving tens of fists, he was still complete and unharmed.

The next moment, a flow of yuan qi that was hot and cold entered into his body.

"This is..."

[Shadow] was surprised to discover that this yuan qi flow that was hot and cold, wherever it passed, it suppressed his yuan qi that was about to go berserk.

At the same time, [War God’s] fists were like lightning. It constantly struck on his body like a storm.

No matter what part of his body it was, every time he was struck by a fist, his state of demonic fire that was going berserk would lessen a bit accompanied by severe pain.

"He's helping me?"

Such a thought flickered in [Shadow's] mind.

He hesitated for a moment, then got rid of all his muddled thoughts. He fluctuated his cultivation technique, focusing, and began ordering the chaotic yuan qi within his body.

Ang Ang Ang Ang!

Dragon roar after dragon roar began unendingly echoing throughout the training camp.

Every time it sounded, it represented the fact that Ye Qingyu had struck with his fist.

The surrounding young experts as well as the two instructors focused, their eyes widening. Time passed on second by second. In the blink of an eye, fifteen minutes had passed. Ye Qingyu had already struck over a hundred thousand fists.

Ultimately, Ye Qingyu's entire person was covered by mist, completely wrapped in white vapour.

The speed that he let out his fist was also not as fast as in the beginning. Fist after fist, this was already something that even a normal person would be able to see his fists.

But after every fist, the dragon roar in the air would become louder and clearer.

It was different from the pure dragon roar at the beginning. The roar of the fist right now held a true hint of a dragon's might within. It was as if there was truly a divine dragon roaring in the sky, bringing with it the aura of the Dragon Race.

"Damn him," the battle technique instructor cursed.

The body refinement instructor Bao Shinu also bit his teeth. "Damn him."

They were both extremely shaken to their limit. That was why they could not help but curse.

They had really been frightened by a monster like Ye Qingyu.

They naturally knew of the mysteries behind the [Dragon Fist]. After all, they were also part of the group that had once been selected. They were lucky enough to be taught [Dragon Fist], and they were immersed in the might of the [Dragon Fist]. They naturally knew of the profoundness of the [Dragon Fist]. One of its abilities was to use the power of the [Dragon Fist] to remove the demon's in one's heart. But they could not do such a thing, even now.

For Ye Qingyu to be able to do such a thing, even though he only had interaction with the [Dragons Fist] for a couple of days?

How would it not make them curse?

Furthermore, everytime Ye Qingyu let out a fist, there was a Dao essence contained within that even the two of them could not clearly understand within its moves. The roar of the dragons became increasingly clear and was no longer just sound effects. It was a true dragon's might that caused the two to not help but shiver in fright.

Right now, they finally understood why in Ye Qingyu's history he could, in just a short year, to turn from a young man who had not learnt any martial arts, to a prodigy of the martial way. Such monstrous talent and comprehension, it was like, it was like...

Bao Shinu did his best to think. "It was like", just who was he similar to. But after thinking back and forth, he discovered that in all those martial tyrant figures that he knew of, there was no one that was able to do such a thing like Ye Qingyu.

The other young experts, although they were not as sure as the two instructors of what exactly happened, but they could faintly feel something. Everyone of them had wide eyes, not willing to miss Ye Qingyu's every action on the arena.

Because they were currently learning [Dragon Fist] from Ye Qingyu.

The essence and profoundness of the [Dragon Fist] that Ye Qingyu exhibited was something that they had never even thought of. For them, this was unquestionably a process that would rarely ever come to them so that they could comprehend.

In the blink of an eye, another fifteen minutes passed.

The speed at which Ye Qingyu let out his fist had already lowered to throwing a fist every three or four breaths.

His footsteps were slow, moving around [Shadow].The speed at which he struck with his fist was slow. Every fist he struck on [Shadow] was like a dragonfly landing on water. After such a round, his breathing had also became rapid, his entire person seemingly somewhat fatigued. Evidently, he had spent a great deal of energy.

As for [Shadow], he stood silently where he was, like he was a sculpture. He did not even move slightly, both his eyes shut, as if he was sleeping.

Ang!

The last dragon roar sounded.

Everyone of the young expert's hearts quivered, their faces filled with fear because of the dragon's roar.

The last fist struck out.

Ye Qingyu let out a pale black jet of blood, his figure quivering and taking three or four steps back then stabilizing his figure. Vapours emitted from his body, like the clouds in the skies. Evidently, he had activated his yuan power to it's very limits.

Everyone's hearts was in their throats.

Ye Qingyu silently stood where he was.

The vapour surrounding him gradually dispersed.

Ye Qingyu's entire person was in a strange rhythm. His face was red, his complexion brilliant, and there was the glimmer of jade on his skin. It gave his whole person the glimmer of jewellery, and the fact that his fleshly body was perfect. As they breathed in and out, it was as if it was the Dao of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang.

"Seal off the arena, don't let the others disturb [War God] and [Shadow]."

Bao Shinu shouted in anger.

The complexions of the battle technique instructor was strict as he replied, "En, this matter is important. Let us go personally to protect them."

the two stood by either sides of the arena, and began patiently and silently waiting.

The other experts, had all sorts of differing expressions on their faces.
