Chapter 873:


Chapter 890 - A Visit from the Old Emperor
"Woof... Master, this tree has a wine aroma, mmm... it smells so good... Pooooh... what's this shit, it's so smelly..." The silly dog was so revolted when it sniffed at a snake-scaled vine that it took three steps back.
Ye Qingyu simply ignored its talk.
He kind of missed the unique environment of the Black Demon Abyss, albeit he had no plans to remain here for long. Because, ever since he left the Heaven Wasteland Domain, time had always been a very precious thing which could not be wasted.
By walking along the periphery of the Black Demon Abyss, he arrived at the edge of the reception square. He intended to proceed by crossing the Domain Gate and heading toward the next giant city.
Just then, an unexpected change occurred.
Several beams of flowing light swept across the Void and rapidly sped toward Ye Qingyu.
"Ye Qingyu! I see you... Hold it! Don't try to hide!" Ringing out from far away was a female voice which was as sharp as the grinding of knives, extremely harsh, and yet a little familiar.
Ye Qingyu paused his footsteps, frowning.
Is it her?!
Ye Qingyu already discerned who the owner of the voice was.
"Woof... who's that! Who called my master's noble name!" The silly dog leaped up forcefully and displayed a ferocious look. However, because it remained in its small form, it appeared adorable and somewhat weird.
Just then, those figures appeared and blocked Ye Qingyu's way.
"Hehe, Lord Ye Qingyu, we finally meet again." As this wickedly-laughing and sinister voice rang out, a familiar yet malicious face appeared in front of Ye Qingyu.
It was none other than the Dragon Human Race's malicious elder, who, together with the Third Princess, had previously found Ye Qingyu and wanted to reseize the
[Dragonblood Halberd]
. Out of his incomparable greed, he further intended to squeeze other things out of Ye Qingyu.
Aside from this malicious and greedy elder, the other people were also familiar to Ye Qingyu.
The woman standing in front had a head of red hair that hung down to her waist and a body which was covered in fire-red scaled soft armor. She was gorgeous and arrogant, and possessed a domineering vigor. This was none other than the Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race, while behind her were three experts who had appeared in the Green Xuan Hall.
"You people? Hoho, what are you doing here?" Ye Qingyu's eye beams flashed as sharply as swords, while he spoke in a discourteous tone.
"Hmph, this is none of your business... Where's the
[Dragonblood Halberd]
, Mr. Ye Qingyu? Tell me if it's on you right now!" The Third Princess spoke in an aggressive tone.
She was uninformed of Ye Qingyu's increase in strength, and seeing that he brought along only a strange small white dog, and did not have with him the Black Gold Puppets which possessed Saint realm-equivalent battle strength unlike that day in the Green Xuan Hall, her confidence naturally soared.
Ye Qingyu laughed when he heard her words.
"Don't tell me you came to beg for the halberd again? Third Princess, you truly are like a leopard that can't change its spots. I already returned it once, but you failed to gain its approval because of your lack of virtue, so what can I do? You want another try? If I hand it to you now, wouldn't that be betraying the final wish of your ancestors?" Ye Qingyu raised a slight smile on his face which remained frosty.
"You! You lower domain bastard, how long do you think you can keep the divine weapon of my race..." The Third Princess was embarrassed and enraged by the contempt in Ye Qingyu's words. She was about to strike out when she suddenly thought of something which made her restrain her anger and flip her eyes, before she said, "I don't want to talk nonsense with you. Listen carefully, Lord Ye Qingyu. The old emperor of my race has invited you for a meeting. I urge you to come with me obediently for your own sake, otherwise, I'll surely give you a good taste of the [Dragon Flames] personally bestowed by the old emperor!"
"[Dragon Flames]... what's that? Is it tasty?" Little Nine became excited.
"Dog, this is no place for you to talk." The white-browed, sinister-eyed elder berated.
"You're the dog! Your whole family are dogs!" Little Nine immediately bared its fangs and growled, with the fur throughout its body standing on end.
For some reason, despite being a small dog which was only half an arm in size, several of the Dragon Human Race experts standing to the side could not help shuddering when it revealed such a look.
There was a chill in Ye Qingyu's eyes as he said, "Has the old emperor of the Dragon Human Race personally arrived?"
In front of outsiders, he had to give face to this silly dog.
"Hoho, that's right. We were ordered by the old emperor to wait here and invite you for a meeting," the white-browed elder immediately replied, with the smile on his face growing a little more sinister. "I believe that, being a young man with great talent, you wouldn't be afraid, right?"
Has the old emperor of the Dragon Human Race really come?
Ye Qingyu was bewildered.
Wasn't it said that he's waiting for me in Heaven Connect City? Why did he suddenly come to the Black Demon Abyss?
He naturally would not believe this just based on the account of the Third Princess and the elder.
However, when he released his consciousness power toward the depths of the Black Demon Abyss, he could indeed feel vaguely that there was a tinge of an extremely pure and overbearing True Dragon aura over there.
It thus seemed that the old emperor was really here.
Looks like he couldn't wait for me to return to Heaven Connect City, and so gave chase here. But that's good anyway. If he's really here, we can settle the matter of the [Dragonblood Halberd] early and thereby account to the ancestor who perished in the 18th district.
Although he remained doubtful, he considered for a moment before picking up the silly dog and following the Third Princess into the Black Demon Abyss.
Along the way, the Third Princess and her subordinates used mist to conceal their figures and turned into beams of flowing light that darted toward the depths of the Black Demon Abyss.
Scenes from his memory flashed in his mind as he entered the Black Demon Abyss once more. Because of the never-ending attacks, he had to use all his might to enter the 18th district, where he unexpectedly got to know the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race, the fatty Sheng Yan, and [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. He could not help feeling emotional as he recalled these opportunities which he chanced upon in this dark place.
However, why would the old emperor of the Dragon Human Race choose to meet in the Black Demon Abyss...
Although he had his doubts, he did not really have to worry about the Dragon Human Race setting a trap, given his present strength. And if a violent confrontation really transpired, he had a couple of tricks which should be enough for him to get away even if he was not a match for the old emperor.
Moreover, despite being a lawless, orderless, and chaotic place, the Black Demon Abyss was the territory of the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race in any case. Therefore, they were bound to have some misgivings regardless of what they intended to do.
After considering all this, he dropped his worries.
Meanwhile, under the lead of the Third Princess' party, he and the silly dog arrived at the base of a desolate ridge in the 16th district.
Black Demon qi, which was as surging as fearful billows, gathered all around the lofty mountains. Like tens of millions of tentacles, layers upon layers of strange vegetation crept up to the mountain peaks.
As he stood at the foot of the mountain, Ye Qingyu's eyes suddenly froze.
A faint smell of blood came from all around.
Did a massacre just take place in this district?
If a smell of blood like this was filling the air of any other giant city, there would certainly be quite a stir. However, everyone in the Black Demon Abyss had become accustomed to this kind of thing. As such, the inhabitants of this district appeared numb and indifferent even when they saw a massacre.
Ye Qingyu also sensed a strange True Dragon aura at this moment.
Apparently, unlike the delicate aura of the Third Princess, the True Dragon aura in the air was extremely overbearing and pure, and could even be said to be domineering and tyrannical, to the extent that it was indistinctly forcing back the Black Demon qi.
"The old emperor is up on the mountain. He wants to meet you alone." The Third Princess suddenly stopped walking when she reached the foot of the mountain.
"Lord Ye Qingyu, the old emperor instructed us to escort you up to this point. I believe he has something to talk privately with you. We'll be waiting here." The sinister-eyed elder revealed an odd smile.
After sweeping a glance across the Third Princess and her subordinates and without saying a word, Ye Qingyu turned into a beam of faint-silver flowing light and swept across the air.
...
Moments later.
On the peak of the mountain.
An elder was standing at the absolute summit, facing the other way.
His fire-red long hair was bundled up by a dragon-patterned crown while he was dressed in a golden-locked divine battle armor, every scale of which was covered in vivid dragon patterns that seemed like they could really grow out of the armor, radiant and dazzling like no other. Although the elder's face could not be seen, the vigor of his proud-standing figure was godlike and magnificent to an extreme.
There was probably no one else who could release such vigor and aura.
Almost instantly, Ye Qingyu sensed the surging and overbearing True Dragon aura on the elder's body, and more so detected the latter's unfathomable strength.
As Ye Qingyu gazed at the back-facing figure whose posture did not appear at all inferior to that of the absolute summit, he could not help feeling a sense of admiration for such a pinnacle expert. Straightening his body, he cupped his hands in salute and greeted, "Senior."
However, the old emperor did not turn around.
In fact, he did not say a single word.
A wind sound whistled as black clouds seethed.
A gale blew strongly among the mountain cliffs, lifting the fire-red battle garments while causing the long hair to flutter neatly.
The aura lingering all around the old emperor was vast and powerful, possessing proud heroism and dignity of its own.
After waiting for another moment, Ye Qingyu still did not get a reply.
"Senior, did you ask me to come to discuss the matter of the
[Dragonblood Halberd]
?" He spoke in a louder voice than previously, albeit his attitude remained sincere.
The figure standing at the edge of the cliff remained motionless, while the yuan qi and aura surging in the Void also remained unchanged.
It was as if he had transcended the confines of this universe and cast aside all worldly cares as he stood alone.
The surroundings became as quiet as a dead realm, leaving only the frictional noises of the Black Demon qi flipping endlessly in mid-air.
"This old man is too pretentious." The silly dog whispered while lying on Ye Qingyu's shoulder.
After waiting for a few more moments, Ye Qingyu could not help frowning.

Chapter 874:


Chapter 891 - Strange Transformations on an Isolated Peak (1)


Indeed, Ye Qingyu grew a little dissatisfied with the old emperor's response or lack thereof.

It was rumored that this bigshot of the Dragon Human Race had led the race for many years and could be considered a peerless mighty emperor. As someone who once had a huge battle with [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], he was probably not just a proud person. Although the rumors alleged that he had a cruel and insufferable temperament, he should at least be an expert who could be talked reason to. At this time, however, the posture he was displaying was a touch too haughty.

Ye Qingyu began to wonder if there was a misunderstanding. After all, the Third Princess and her subordinates were unable to take the halberd away from him, and thus might have fanned up some flames behind his back by twisting his words deliberately. As a result, the misinformed old emperor could be bearing an enmity toward him.

After some thinking, Ye Qingyu felt it necessary to provide an explanation.

He thus continued speaking, "Senior, you seem to be very disapproving of me, but I'm sure there's a misunderstanding somewhere. Earlier on, when the Third Princess brought people to the Green Xuan Hall of Heaven Connect City to find me in order to take back the halberd, it was really not that I didn't want to return it, but that the halberd's mind automatically replied and rejected her. And when she and the others kept slandering me in an unreasonable and overbearing manner by claiming that I stole other treasures of the Dragon Human Race, I decided to take back the halberd. Although my domain is a small and backward one with sparse resources, we would never be covetous of the ancestral weapons of other races. Now that you've personally come to collect the halberd, I'll naturally present it with both hands, in fulfilment of your ancestor's final wish. Henceforth, the Heaven Wasteland Domain and the Dragonblood Dynasty have no more obligations to each other."

He saluted after he finished speaking.

He then took the [Dragonblood Halberd] out of the [Cloud Top Cauldron].

Buzzzz!

Bursts of low cries were heard.

The moment the dark-red halberd left the [Cloud Top Cauldron], it seemed to sense something and became unusually eager and agitated, emitting a terrifying and strange burst of power while vibrating rapidly.

What's going on?

Ye Qingyu was startled.

The next moment, however, Ye Qingyu was unable to react before the [Dragonblood Halberd] issued an immense burst of power which forcefully pushed his fingers away.

Swish!

The halberd flew out of his hands and shot into the sky.

The red blood light instantly turned into a dazzling long dragon which seemed to be the divine dragon of the ancient legends. It was extremely fast in speed and vivid, and possessed the pressuring force unique to the Dragon Race. As it circled above the old emperor, its blood light dyed the dark sky completely red.

Has the halberd actually transformed into a dragon?

Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.

This was the first time the halberd actively initiated a strange transformation ever since it fell into his hands. From the looks of it, the aura of the old emperor had aroused its spirit.

Just as well.

Since the halberd had actively recognized its owner, everything became easier to explain. Ye Qingyu did not want to waste too much breath and time here anyway.

However, something which terribly surprised him happened the very next moment...

Roar roar roar!

Three dragon roars resounded through the wilderness.

These roars did not express the joy and enthusiasm of returning to one's rightful race. Instead, they were filled with hard-to-describe sorrow, woe, and sadness, as if one had lost something.

Ye Qingyu was taken aback at once.

Why does the situation feel not quite right?

A moment later, the same kind of roar rang out once more.

It induced winds to blow and the world to tremor.

Shortly after, while Ye Qingyu was still astonished like never before, the blood-red dragon spiralled in the air and eventually plunged down into the old emperor's body.

The world suddenly became dark.

Like water being absorbed into a whale, all of the splendor and divine aura followed the dragon and took just a moment to sink into the old emperor's body, disappearing completely.

In the Void, not a trace of the halberd could be felt, leaving only the Black Demon qi which slowly gathered from all directions.

Other than that, there was nothing but a deathly silence.

"Woof... I never thought that large iron stick would actually contain a dragon... Master, it's such a waste for you to give such an awesome treasure to that old fart..." The silly dog let out a wail, seemingly shaken by the scene of the dragon soaring into the sky.

Without saying a word, Ye Qingyu took a glance at the flopping ball of fur on his shoulder, resisting the urge to pinch it into a different shape.

He looked once more at the figure standing upright at the top of the cliff. Until now, the old emperor still had not moved in the slightest and simply remained standing quietly there. He had not turned his body or opened his mouth to talk, as if oblivious to everything that happened around him.

Ye Qingyu indistinctly realized that the situation today was not quite right.

However, he could not tell exactly what was not quite right.

A bizarre aura circulated in the air.

After thinking, he decided that it would be best to leave.

"Now that the halberd has been returned to you, I have ultimately not betrayed the final wish of your ancestor. I have done everything I ought to have done, and henceforth, the Heaven Wasteland Domain and the Dragon Human Race have no more obligations to each other." He cupped his hands.

Naturally, he had done some consideration before making such a point.

Previously, the words and actions of the Third Princess' party had already disgusted him, and that was compounded by the old emperor's attitude today. By expressing the Heaven Wasteland Domain's non-association with them in the future, he believed that a lot of trouble would be saved.

However, the old emperor remained unresponsive.

========================================

Chapter 875:


On the absolute summit, battle garments and hair fluttered.

He remained tall and mighty as he stood quietly. He had neither turned his head nor moved, as if completely fascinated by the distant sight of the boundless land below the peak. His burly figure seemed undisturbed by the passing of time and completely cut off from the worldly hubbub.

"Old thing, do you not know how to say a word of thanks?" Little Nine waved its paws disdainfully.

Ye Qingyu shook his head.

He looked with some uncertainty at the back-facing figure which gave off an immense saintly pressure. He wondered why the [Dragonblood Halberd] would let out a shrilling lament when it clearly recognized its owner and returned to its rightful sect, as evident from its response that was the sudden explosion of battle-level spiritual qi. He vaguely felt that the state of the old emperor was not quite right, albeit he could confirm from the latter's aura that it was undoubtedly the old emperor, for no one else could possess such an overbearing dragon blood aura. And there was no chance that his judgment was wrong, given that his body now contained the True Dragon formation prints which made his perception of the Dragon Race aura most sensitive and clear.

However, it was meaningless to wait on if the old emperor continued to be unresponsive.

Besides, the tactless dog on his shoulder might, at any time, say something that provoked the pinnacle Great Saint. If that should happen, it would promptly be turned into stewed dog meat, and he would be left to clear up the mess it caused.

After waiting for a while longer and seeing that the old emperor remained motionless, he cupped his hands and said, "The treasure has been returned to its owner in perfect condition. I shall now take my leave."

With that, he released yuan qi and was about to turn into flowing light to leave.

But just then, a strange change occurred.

Roar!

A dragon roar which contained infinite sadness and rage was heard from within the old emperor's body, momentarily resounding through the world.

The Void around the peak was torn apart by the nearly-tangible sound waves evoked by this roar, while black clouds frantically churned.

Swish!

A clear whistling sound rang out.

As a red radiance flickered, the blood-red divine dragon which had plunged into the old emperor's body suddenly flew out and circled in the air above, emanating a layer of extremely dazzling blood light and piercingly cold evil qi.

Roar roar roar!

Bouts of dragon roars were heard once again, sounding very much like shrilling, mourning cries.

Interweaving in gold and red, a beam of electric splendor flickered as the divine dragon swept across the air like a rainbow and unexpectedly descended into Ye Qingyu's hands, once again turning into a [Dragonblood Halberd].

Huh?

Ye Qingyu was stupefied.

Why has the [Dragonblood Halberd] returned to me?

Wh... what's going on?

Lowering his head, he saw that the blood light lingering around the halberd had become somewhat dull. Like a warrior which had fought to the death on a battlefield and prevailed with a bloodied body, it softly let out a quivering cry which contained a mix of heroism, sorrow, and grief.

Ye Qingyu did not understand what was going on.

Could it be that the old emperor no longer wants this [Dragonblood Halberd] and thus bestowed it to me? That's impossible. Its importance to the Dragonblood Dynasty is equivalent to that of the imperial jade seal. Having recovered it after so much trouble, there's absolutely no reason why he would give it to an outsider.

But he had no time to dwell on it, for something even stranger happened.

As a strange wave motion circulated at the peak, the vast and surging True Dragon aura suddenly disintegrated and dissipated. At the same time, the originally-upright figure of the emperor swayed gently and collapsed like a suddenly-felled ancient tree.

Thump.

As stiff and motionless as a corpse, the burly and valiant body fell on the ground.

What's going on?!

Ye Qingyu was greatly shaken.

What happened? The old emperor... collapsed? How can this happen to an expert like him? Could it be a sudden illness... That's impossible, a being of his level is immune to all diseases, and wouldn't suffer lapses... Could this figure actually be a fake? But that can't be, otherwise, why would the halberd respond and change as it did?

For some time, Ye Qingyu could not find any clues, and simply felt that everything happening in front of him was extremely unimaginable. As such, he did not rashly draw near.

From afar, the old emperor's body appeared as stiff and straight as a fallen tree. All of its divine might and vigor were nowhere to be found, such that it resembled the body of a normal person.

Without needing to release divine consciousness, Ye Qingyu could already sense that the body was devoid of all breath, and that there was not a strand of vitality oozing out of it.

The old emperor of the Dragon Human Race was like a dead man.

As he sensed all this, Ye Qingyu's countenance dullened.

"Senior?” he cautiously tried asking.

There was no response.

A mountain wind glided by, stirring up the black clouds.

After hesitating for a brief while, Ye Qingyu nervously operated his yuan qi as a precaution and then slowly drew near.

Chapter 876:


Chapter 893 - The Deceased Mighty Emperor


"Senior... Senior?" After some hesitation, Ye Qingyu drew closer and tried calling out to him again.

There was still no response.

Under Ye Qingyu's watchful gaze, over the next dozen breaths, the retired emperor's body lay on the ground, as still as a corpse. No matter how many times he tried to call out to him, he did not receive a response, nor did he react at all.

The closer he got, the clearer the retired emperor's body became.

The body on the ground looked to be about sixty years of age; his face was thin and well-defined and his blood-colored eyebrows were like flames. There was a pair of long horns that grew from his forehead just like a True Dragon. In addition to his mighty aura, he also exuded some elegance and nobility, which showed that he was an extremely formidable character. Even though there were signs of life in him, his aura and appearance were enough to make one feel a strong oppressive force.

Ye Qingyu was less than ten meters away from the body and could clearly sense that there was no pulse within this retired emperor's body. His life had seeped out of him at that moment earlier and he now resembled a piece of withered rotten wood. Furthermore, there were no ripples of energy nor life in the surrounding area.

It looked just like a dead human corpse.

Is he truly dead?

Ye Qingyu's shock and astonishment grew.

He was almost certain that the retired emperor of the Dragonblood Dynasty was dead. He had once been a mighty emperor at the highest level, so there was no reason for him to act dead just to deceive him... But this was also the most suspicious point. How could someone of such stature, who had stunned the Vast Thousand Domains for thousands of years and who was basically the most powerful thing in existence in this world, die in these remote mountains? And why was his manner of death so odd?

What was going on?

Ye Qingyu's shock could not be expressed in words. He sensed that this was a nefarious plot. The Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race had asked him to come into the mountains alone to see the retired emperor. So, could she be the mastermind behind the plot? He thought for a moment, then rejected that notion. He was absolutely certain that she did not have the brains to lay out such a plot, and she and the others simply did not have the prowess to kill the retired emperor of the Dragon Human Race. Any plot would be laughable and powerless in the face of absolute power.

Unless...

Unless there was an even more formidable character who supported the Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race.

That person had to stand at the absolute summit of power and had to be as powerful as the retired emperor of the Dragon Human Race.

Ye Qingyu took a deep breath.

He knew that once news of this got out, it would definitely shake the entire Vast Thousand Domains to its core.

Suddenly, a fine light flashed through his mind and understanding dawned.

The retired emperor of the Dragon Human Race was probably dead even before he climbed up the summit of this mountain. His corpse had always been standing here but his breath had yet to fully dissipate after his death. After all, he was such a formidable expert that remnants of his aura would have remained after his death. This explained why he was able to sense the aura of this top expert, and this was probably why he initially did not realize that the retired emperor was already dead. It wasn't until the [Dragonblood Halberd] appeared later...

No wonder the [Dragonblood Halberd] was able to let out three sorrowful cries. It must have sensed the death of its retired emperor and grieved for him.

As for why the retired emperor's aura and power completely disappeared in an instant, that was clearly because of the [Dragonblood Halberd]. Some kind of mysterious transformation could have occurred after the [Dragonblood Halberd] transformed into a dragon and entered the retired emperor's body. This was connected to the secret of the Dragon Human Race's ancestral weapon, so he would not be able to figure it out for the time being.

The mountain wind was bitterly cold.

Dark clouds rolled overhead.

Many things now made sense to him, but he still had many unanswered questions as well that he just could not figure out.

"Hehehehe... Master, I can't believe you just wasted so much time speaking to a corpse..." Little Nine said excitedly, as though things were not serious enough.

Ye Qingyu ignored this silly dog.

He had a feeling that he should leave this place immediately, for it was clearly a trap. However, when he remembered how the Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race and that malicious old Dragon Human Race elder had witnessed him climbing up the mountain, he decided not to escape, but to remain at the scene.

In approximately fifteen minutes—just as he expected.

Dozens of splendors suddenly flashed in the Void far away, and they all charged toward the mountain, their speed as fast as flowing light and lightning.

The corners of his eyes curved up slightly and his gaze turned cold.

The splendor flickered to reveal their figures.

There were dozens of people, and five or six of them exuded a powerful aura. These few people were clearly in the Saint realm—they might even be Great Saints. The Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race and the others were also part of the group.

"Hmm? What happened, Your Highness..." The moment the Third Princess appeared, she reacted like a stunned sparrow upon seeing the retired emperor's corpse while exclaiming loudly. She was a picture of grief and concern.

Ye Qingyu scoffed coldly.

This was such bad acting.

He had still suspected that perhaps this Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race had nothing to do with the retired emperor's death, but the timing of her appearance along with so many experts was too much of a coincidence. Her exaggerated expressions and acting dissipated the last remnants of his doubts. He was almost certain that this stupid princess definitely had something to do with this.

"You!" The Third Princess pointed at him and asked accusingly, "What did you do? Why... Your Highness, what happened?"

"Oh?" Ye Qingyu responded indifferently. His gaze swept past those five or six figures with formidable auras as he discerned their auras. Then, he looked back at the Third Princess with narrowed eyes and continued calmly, "You mean, you can't even tell? Your retired emperor is now dead."

"You?" The Third Princess was slightly taken aback, then an almost imperceptible flash of viciousness appeared in her eyes and she shouted, "You murderous thief! How dare you kill our retired emperor just to claim the treasure of our Dragon Human Race as your own! You... you are absolutely heartless and you will be punished by the heavens. You..."

Ye Qingyu smiled when he saw how enraged she was, "Alright, stop acting. To be honest, your acting is extremely bad and I don't have the patience to continue watching it... You had first done your research about my whereabouts, then lured me up this lone peak, then brought so many people to appear in such a timely manner... Hmm, isn't that too much of a coincidence?"

"What... what do you mean?" the Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race asked angrily, but her breath slightly faltered subconsciously.

Ye Qingyu smiled, then continued, "Didn't you say earlier that your retired emperor had forbidden all of you to scale this mountain and only wanted to see me? Why have you brought so many people up this mountain then? Hmm?"

"I..." The Third Princess' breath caught in her throat. She did not know how to respond at that moment.

When the malicious old Dragon Human Race elder saw that things had taken a turn for the worse, he immediately stepped up and smiled cunningly. Then he said, "Her Highness was worried when she could no longer sense His Highness's aura, so she quickly led us up here. Who could have predicted that we would run into you after you committed such a despicable, evil, and cruel act? Now that we have all the evidence here, you won't be able to get out of this no matter how well you may try to twist the truth."

"Yes, things are finally starting to make sense." Ye Qingyu smiled. At this moment, he was surprisingly calm as he looked at the malicious old Dragon Human Race elder and said, "Let's see, you're saying that this stupid princess could not detect the retired emperor's aura, but why didn't she assume that it is because he had left after obtaining the [Dragonblood Halberd]? Does your retired emperor need to inform you before he leaves this mountain?"

"Um..." The old Dragon Human Race elder was slightly stunned but he quickly recovered to say, "While it is true that His Highness might have left, we, as the disciples of the Dragon Human Race, would naturally need to ensure his safety. It would make sense for us to check on him up here. There is nothing wrong with that."

"Alright, even if I accept your explanation, I would still like to ask if you think that I am actually powerful enough to kill this peerless mighty emperor who had stunned the Vast Thousand Domains? Hmm?" Ye Qingyu asked as a faint shadow of a smile danced across his lips. "If I had the power to kill the retired emperor, then you guys..." He raised his hand to point at them contemptuously, then continued, "Then you guys do not really seem like loyal subjects. If I had the power to kill someone who was a half-step to a Quasi-emperor, you would have fled a long time ago, am I right? Why would you dare to scale this lone peak? Haha, you must have really thought so highly of yourselves."

The old Dragon Human Race elder's surprise turned to anger as he said, "How dare you spout such malicious words after killing our retired emperor! You've even insulted our princess... I will not spare you today."

Ye Qingyu's smile became even more contemptuous and disdainful. "Why? You have no more excuses so you're starting to spout nonsense, is that it?"

The old Dragon Human Race elder was about to retort...

Then, a figure in the corner, whose features were obscured by his black-hooded cloak, suddenly spoke. His voice was hoarse but he enunciated each word clearly as he said, "Ye Qingyu, we the Human Race have always dared to take responsibility for our actions. You have stolen the secret treasure of the Dragon Human Race and mercilessly killed their retired emperor in order to satisfy your own selfish desires. Even though I am a Human Race martial artist, your actions are inexcusable. I heard that in recent years, the retired emperor was at the end of his life and his strength had dipped significantly. He was only a shadow of his former self which explains how you managed to kill him. There is nothing suspicious about that at all. It shows how benevolent the retired emperor had been, for he did not think you were as evil as the rumors made you out to be, and agreed to meet with you privately to persuade you to hand over their treasure. No one expected you to be so evil as to secretly ambush His Highness, then turn around and try to lay the blame on the Third Princess. You must know that the Third Princess and the retired emperor are blood relatives, so why would she do such a thing?"

Ye Qingyu's eyes hardened after he heard those words.

"Human Race? You are of the Human Race?" His gaze fell on the cloaked figure. For some reason, this figure seemed familiar to him, and so he frowned and asked, "Since you're here, why do you need to obscure your features? If you dare to speak up, why won't you show your face? Are you ashamed to reveal yourself?"

That person was silent for a moment, then he said hoarsely, "I am an upright man and have nothing to be ashamed of. My conscience is clear, so why would I be ashamed? It is beneath me to reveal my face to a human as despicable as yourself."

Ye Qingyu scoffed and said, "You're just a shady creature hiding in the dark. I'll go first since I'd like to see what kind of face lies beneath that cloak... [Eyes of the Void]!"

Two rays of small lightning shot from his eyes.
