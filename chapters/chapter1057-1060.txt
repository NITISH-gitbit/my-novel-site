Chapter 1057:



Chapter 1072 - The Storm Cauldron


"What?" Lin Baiyi was shocked and said angrily, "How dare these damn Dragon Humans seize this opportunity to take advantage of us?"

The conflict between the Dragon Human Race and Heaven Wasteland Domain had been brewing for some time - rumors had swirled about their conflict for some time and there were several occasions when it had almost led to war, but thankfully, this conflict had been barely contained. However, no one expected their enemy who had been eyeing them for some time to suddenly make their move when there was internal strife within their domain.

This was only going to make things worse.

"The Dragon Humans?" Ye Qingyu smiled when he heard the news instead of being enraged.

Were these Dragon Humans who were an offshoot and descendants of the ancient dragons according to legend, finally about to make their move?

It was clear to him that the Dragon Human Domain had undergone some changes.

"Brother Lin Baiyi, please send a message back and tell Her Majesty not to engage them in battle. Tell her to give up the territories of the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race but she must not engage in them head-on in battle," he said after some thought. Then, he looked at the Great Dragon Turtle Demon and said, "Make some changes to the Domain Gate's backup plan. I've decided to not go back to the Heaven Wasteland Domain."

"Ah?"

Great Dragon Turtle Demon and Lin Baiyi were both astonished.

"My lord, do you mean to..." Great Dragon Turtle Demon asked in confusion.

Ye Qingyu smiled as he replied, "It'd be rude not to reciprocate their 'kindness', so I'll be headed to the Dragon Human Domain."

Lin Baiyi's eyes lit up as understanding dawned and he said, "Do you mean to... relieve the besieged by attacking the base of the enemy?"

This was a good idea.

If it was possible, the best solution was to take this battle away from Heaven Wasteland Domain since this will prevent innocent civilians and lives from being affected. Ye Qingyu's current cultivation and strength were enough to single-handedly strike fear throughout an entire domain and could defeat an army of thousands without any assistance as well. If he went on a killing rampage throughout the Dragon Human Domain, this would force Xu Wuya, the War God of the Dragon Human Race back to the Dragon Human Domain to rescue them, then Heaven Wasteland Domain would no longer be in danger."

Ye Qingyu smiled and said, "In a way, yes."

...

In the quiet room of the Heaven Wasteland Buildingâ€”

Ye Qingyu laid out a formation that blocked out the surrounding aura.

The white pill furnace appeared in his hand.

"Tell me everything from the very beginning. Who are you working for and where are all your accomplices?" he asked as he removed the noise-canceling formation on the pill furnace.

"Ha ha ha ha..." a burst of cold and malicious laughter could be heard from the within the pill furnace as Wei Wubing replied, "Do you think I'd tell you anything?"

Ye Qingyu smiled coldly and said, "I assumed that you would have told me everything. You murdered Mister Ren Puyang, so you should know that I would do anything in order to achieve my goals. If you refuse to spill the beans, I'm afraid that you'd have to suffer and once you can no longer bear the pain, you'd end up telling me everything anyway, so why don't we save each other some time?"

"Ha ha ha ha, why don't you go ahead and try then?" Wei Wubing scoffed coldly.

As an ancient demonic being, he had been through all sorts of experiences and was different from an ordinary living creature, so why would he fear any kind of torturous interrogation method?

"Sure," Ye Qingyu nodded.

A bright red flame appeared in his palm and he lit the pill furnace.

The white pill furnace suddenly underwent a mysterious change and gave off dazzling silvery-white splendor.

This was one of the pill furnaces from the Yin-Yang Formation in [Tusita Palace] that was located in the middle of the maze of the Reincarnation Hall and it had previously contained the Deathlike Pills. It was now used by him to store things and to refine divine artifacts and since this pill furnace was an ancient artifact, it was extremely precious and incredibly powerful. Otherwise, it would not be able to hold a demonic creature like Wei Wubing prisoner. During his spare time, he had also taken some time to refine this pill furnace, so he had already figured out how to operate this item.

He would use this pill furnace to refine Wei Wubing today.

The moment he operated the pill furnace, wind and thunder formed within it and the huge rumbling sounds of thunder could be heard.

"Ah..." Wei Wubing's terrified shrieks could be heard. "What exactly is this? How... how did you come across this item?"

Ye Qingyu remained silent as he continued to exert the pill furnace.

Next came the sounds of wind and rain.

The wind howled angrily and the rain beat down heavily in the cauldron!

This was one of the strange effects a top-level pill furnace could produce.

A true divine-level pill furnace might look as though it ran on the power of fire, but instead of heating up its contents like ordinary mortals would imagine it to do, it could activate its own magical formation to turn the outside energy into various forms of universal forces. Then, it had the ability to generate wind, rain, electricity, snow, ice, earth, the five elemental properties and so forth within it. This white jade pill furnace was known as the [Storm Cauldron] and it could generate wind and rain, then draw on this power to refine pills.

At that moment, Wei Wubing was feeling the pain of being beaten by both wind and rain.

This was no ordinary wind and rain. The wind was a destructive wind and the rain was a weak rain, these were all targeted to hurt the spirit.

"Ah ah..." Wei Wubing's terrified cries could be heard from the pill furnace.

Ye Qingyu ignored him and operated the one hundred eight ancient characters secret technique, then the [Storm Cauldron] slowly turned in circles. Then, it spun out of his palm to land on the ground in front of him and turned into a huge white jade furnace that was two meters tall. All kinds of ancient formations were carved on its body as though these formations had formed naturally. They were freckled with age and continuously absorbed the flames that he created.

The sounds of wind and rain grew even louder within the pill furnace.

Wei Wubing's screams became louder and more pitiful and he sounded like a half-dead pig shrieking with a knife already embedded in its neck.

But he refused to admit defeat.

Time ticked by slowly.

Soon, he had already refined Wei Wubing within that pill furnace for an hour.

Wei Wubing's howls grew more miserable, then gradually became weaker as though a huge amount of energy had been sapped from him.

However, no matter how loudly he shrieked, he never once begged for mercy.

Ye Qingyu's brows furrowed slightly.

This demonic creature's resolve was stronger than he had imagined.

"If I continue to refine him in this pill furnace, he would probably die," he thought and found that this issue had become a little trickier than expected. Wei Wubing and that Puppet Bloodworm from the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain were probably the same creatures but Wei Wubing was clearly much stronger and more determined than the Puppet Bloodworm. He could be considered a hero amongst the demons.

Afterwards, he continued to refine Wei Wubing for another fifteen minutes.

Wei Wubing's screams gradually grew weaker and it was clear that he had become extremely frail.

Ye Qingyu asked him many times but Wei Wubing refused to speak, neither did he surrender.

This would complicate matters.

Ye Qingyu put a temporary halt to this process.

If he ended up killing Wei Wubing, then he would be killing his only witness.

After some thought, he took out the blood pill that the Puppet Bloodworm was trapped in.

He had once handed this Puppet Bloodworm to Ren Puyang and after Ren Puyang found the information he was after, he had returned it to Ye Qingyu. Now, Ye Qingyu wanted this Puppet Bloodworm to tell him how he could force Wei Wubing to spill the information that he knew. After all, they were similar organisms, so this Puppet Bloodworm might have a better understanding of Wei Wubing.

Before he could even ask the question, the Puppet Bloodworm seemed to have already read his mind and started to anxiously crash against the blood pill that trapped it as it howled loudly, "Let me eat him, let me eat him. I'll recognize you as my master and I'll never betray you..."

It was clearly extremely anxious.

Ye Qingyu paused for a moment, then he understood that it wanted to eat Wei Wubing.

"Wei Wubing is still useful to me. I need to force him to spill the information he knows," he looked at the blood pill and said telepathically, "If you have a way to make him talk, I could hand him over to you once I'm done with him."

"This is easy. It is way too simple...After I've eaten him, I would possess all his memories. Then, I'll be able to tell you whatever information you wish to know," the Puppet Bloodworm screamed.

He asked a little suspiciously, "Is it really that simple?"

"This is an innate ability that our race has always had. If we eat our fellow kind, it would be inheriting their bloodline..." the Puppet Bloodworm explained shrilly. It seemed very anxious and swam madly within the blood pill excitedly, as though it was a precious and rare opportunity for it.

He thought for a moment, then finally agreed to the Puppet Bloodworm's proposal.

This was the only thing he could do since he would not be able to get any information from Wei Wubing otherwise.

"Alright. Remember this promise that you've made. If you dare to deceive me, I'll make sure that I'll kill you immediately," he finally said after mulling over this matter. Then, he sent the blood pill in the [Storm Cauldron] and simultaneously summoned the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. He unleashed its power that enveloped and sealed the entire quiet room in order to prevent any unwanted accidents.

Finally, he removed the seal of the blood pill that was now within the pill furnace.

Rumble! Rumble!

A huge rumble exploded from the [Cloud Top Cauldron], as though it was suddenly buffeted by huge wind and rains.

"This is insubordination, you..." Wei Wubing growled angrily.

The Puppet Bloodworm retorted angrily, "We share the same blood but I was born in Chaos and am not from that place, so there is no insubordination to speak of. Ha ha ha, this is a really great opportunity for me. Once I absorb your strength, I would be able to obtain everything you have. Ha ha ha..."it shrieked excitedly.

A fierce battle seemed to be happening within the [Storm Cauldron].

Ye Qingyu quietly observed the situation.

He had full control of the pill furnace and thus could see everything that happened within it.

Fifteen minutes later, the strange phenomenon that was happening within [Storm Cauldron] gradually dissipated.

The Puppet Bloodworm had swallowed Wei Wubing.

All his energy, resolve, memories and spirit... all of these had been absorbed by the Puppet Bloodworm. Their race had always been blessed with the innate ability to absorb all things and this was an innate magical ability that was comparable to the power of laws. Wei Wubing used to be extremely powerful but he had been defeated by Ye Qingyu and had been refined within the [Storm Cauldron] for more than an hour, so he was already extremely weak. Even though he used to be a powerful expert of his race, he was still defeated by the Puppet Bloodworm and vanished from this universe.

The Puppet Bloodworm was extremely elated after it absorbed Wei Wubing.

It worked hard to convert Wei Wubing's strength and memories into its own.

Moments laterâ€”

"Tell me everything you know now," Ye Qingyu said.

The Puppet Bloodworm was silent for a moment, then layers of dark red light circles appeared on its body and it looked extremely pleased with itself as it laughed maniacally, "Ha ha ha, you foolish human, did you truly think that I would tell you anything? Ha ha ha, now that I've absorbed the yuan essence of an Emperor-level Dark Demon, ha ha ha, you will never be able to imprison me again. I will..."

"Moron."

Ye Qingyu interrupted the Puppet Bloodworm's speech with a shake of his head.

Chapter 1058:


Chapter 1073 â€“ White-boned Earth Dragon War Body
This thing was truly a moron. Itâ€™s thought process was like a single-cell organism. It did not even stop to consider the fact that he had already defeated and refined Wei Wubing, so why would its fate be any different?
Once again, he activated the [Storm Cauldron].
"Aahâ€¦ Ow, ow, owâ€¦ This is going to kill meâ€¦" The Puppet Bloodworm shrieked in agony like a pig being slaughtered.
It tried to draw on its newly obtained strength to resist the [Storm Cauldron], but the formidable force of the [Storm Cauldron] crushed all its resistance.
"Ah, impossible. What exactly is that thing? Human, how could youâ€¦ Ah, stop, stop, stop. I surrender, I surrenderâ€¦" The Puppet Bloodworm immediately admitted defeat in stark contrast to the "stubborn" Wei Wubing. This Puppet Bloodworm did not have any moral integrity to begin with, so the moment it knew that it could not defeat Ye Qingyu and it experienced a bit of pain, it immediately surrendered.
Ye Qingyu's face darkened as he continued to exert the [Storm Cauldron].
The Puppet Bloodworm continued to shriek like a pig being killed, frantically begging for mercy.
Ye Qingyu only stopped fifteen minutes later.
He wanted this Puppet Bloodworm to suffer and fear him.
"Spill," Ye Qingyu said.
"I will, I will. Master, you're matchless in power and authority, and no one else has been as powerful as you since the ancient times. A worm like me must have done many good deeds in my past three lifetimes to have the honor of being your war petâ€¦" The Puppet Bloodworm's attitude suddenly changed as it referred to itself as a worm and did its best to pour compliments on Ye Qingyu shamelessly.
"Get straight to the point. You know what I'm after." Ye Qingyu did not go easy on it at all.
"Alright, alright," the worm replied. Then after some hesitation, it continued, "He is an Emperor-level Dark Demon, so I'll need some time to access his memories after I've absorbed him. This process is similar to how you humans awaken your blood, soâ€¦ I don't really know much either. Iâ€¦"
Ye Qingyu's face hardened. "Are you trying to trick me?"
"No, no, noâ€¦" The little worm was frightened out of its wits as it hastily explained, "These memories are very fuzzy to me. I caught a glimpse of several scenes. Before he died, this Dark Demon had been plotting somethingâ€¦ I can see him meeting with several creaturesâ€¦ they were plotting togetherâ€¦ something about the Dragon Raceâ€¦ Oh yes, I heard the word 'dragonblood' being mentioned... Wait, these creatures aren't from the Dragon Raceâ€¦ they are humans who carry the aura of the Dragon Raceâ€¦ Hmm? Is there really such a race?"
Ye Qingyu was extremely stunned by the Bloodworm's words.
Humans who carried the aura of the Dragon Race?
Dragonblood?
The Dragon Human Race!
Could the Dragon Human Race be involved in Ren Puyang's death?
This also meant that those who had joined forces and plotted with Wei Wubing to murder Ren Puyang definitely included experts of the Dragon Human Race.
"The Dragon Human Race? Great, this saves me time. I was on my way to the Dragon Human Domain anyway, so I'll use this chance to conduct a thorough investigation. If they were truly part of the plot to murder Ren Puyang, this shows that the Dragon Human Race have completely gone over to the dark side. Thenâ€¦" Ye Qingyu's eyes flashed with sharp killing intent and the temperature in the quiet room suddenly dropped while the light in the Void twisted.
The little worm in the [Storm Cauldron] trembled in fright, not daring to say anything else.
He quickly reined in his emotions.
His gaze fell on the [Storm Cauldron].
"I can't always keep this worm captive in the [Storm Cauldron], but it has absorbed part of Wei Wubing's soul. This means that it has now obtained his cultivation and strength and even his memories, so it'd be a waste to kill it. This worm is weak and cowardly, afraid of the strong while bullying the weak. So it is relatively easy to controlâ€¦" He mulled it over for a while, then an idea came to him.
"I've got a plan."
He remembered Wei Wubing's large skeletal frame.
He summoned the white bones that he collected from the Fallen God Abyss of the 17th district of the Black Demon Abyss from his [Cloud Top Cauldron].
These white bones were extremely tough and looked similar to Wei Wubing's skeletal frame. No one other than a Quasi-emperor would be able to destroy these bones. And the reason why he managed to kill Wei Wubing was because of the purple qi that his [Blood Drinker Sword] had absorbed from Quasi-emperor Mushan when he died. He had been wondering how to put these white bones to good use and now he had a plan.
He categorized all the white bones according to size, length, width, and shape. Then, an expectant expression appeared on his face.
He planned to piece these white bones together to form a White-boned War Body that resembled Wei Wubing's.
This was not a difficult task for him because he had given this matter a lot of thought and also examined Wei Wubing's War Body, but he still took some time to piece the body together. It took him one hour before this skeletal frame finally took on a formâ€”it was a White-boned reptilian monster that was more than a dozen meters long with large wings, and it looked like the Earth Dragon from the ancient era.
He did not choose to form a human-shaped War Body like Wei Wubing.
He felt that he could only form a true war machine if it took the form of a beast. He was not like Wei Wubing, who needed a human body in order to hide his identity. Instead, his priority was how this body could be used to his advantage in battle. So, he designed this body to be as effective as possible in battle and finally pieced together a White-boned monster. Another important reason for his actions was that he had found a giant dragon-shaped skull in his collection of white bones by chance.
The first step was to piece these bones together.
Then, he started to carve formations onto the bones.
He turned the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] into a blood-colored, rune engraving tool, and used the purple Emperor qi that was contained within it to start carving runes on the bones. This was the only thing that could leave a mark on these bones, and the formation that he selected was completely different from the current runes that were employed throughout the Vast Thousand Domains. Instead, he combined the occult technique from one hundred eight ancient characters with the records he read at [Formation Emperor] Luoso's palace library to develop a unique formation.
This process was relatively slow and it took him four hours to complete the task.
The White-boned Earth Dragon was made up of one thousand and one1 white bones of varying shapes and sizes. And at that moment, each bone was covered in the thin, ancient markings of a formation that swirled around each bone like a bright red strand of hair. The faint Emperor qi that it contained had yet to be activated, but this War Body already gave off an astonishing aura. This War Body had become even more powerful due to Quasi-emperor Mushan's purple Emperor qi that was embedded within it.
The War Body was complete.
But it lacked a soul.
This was similar to how the golden war puppets of the Alliance of Domains could be activated by formations but needed to be controlled by a "key". They only knew how to kill, but were unable to think autonomously, so although they were still considered high-quality war puppets, they were still a far cry from how his ideal war puppet would be. He wanted to create a war puppet with its own autonomous thinking, but this was extremely difficult because even the ancient great emperors had found it difficult to grasp the complexities of the soul.
However, he would now be able to make full use of his resources.
He exerted the [Storm Cauldron], opened its lid, and tipped the Puppet Bloodworm out of it.
"Get in there!" Ye Qingyu shouted and exerted a sealing technique.
His hands moved through the Void and made layers of mysterious markings on it that resembled layers of a silver web. Then, he drew on the primeval world power within the quiet room to force the Puppet Bloodworm, which was still in a daze, into the White-boned Earth Dragon War Body.
Boom!
A strange power immediately surged out from the White-boned Earth Dragon War Body.
He examined it anxiously.
The formation engraved on the white bones started to operate silently. Then, rays of strange light flowed along the rune markings on the body. It was very faint in the beginning, but soon afterward, this light grew more and more dazzling and the power surged within it. It was so powerful that even he was shocked.
Not long after that, he could clearly sense a faint lifeforce from within the White-boned Earth Dragon.
Did he succeed?
He was overjoyed.
Two red balls of light appeared in the White-boned Earth Dragon's eye sockets.
Then, its large body gradually shook as though it was trying to walk.
"Master?"
The White-boned Earth Dragon opened its mouth and the air vibrated in its throat as it forced an almost unintelligible voice out of its newfound body.
"My body. Iâ€¦" The little worm was clearly not used to its new body and it was overcome by a strange sensation, as though it were a newborn child. The moment it moved its body, it fell on the ground with a loud bang.
"You should take some time to get used to it," Ye Qingyu said patiently.
The little worm would need a bit of time to adapt to its new body, but it was the perfect candidate to control this War Body because Puppet Bloodworms only had souls but lacked bodies. This worm was like Wei Wubing, so after it grew accustomed to its body, its combat strength would be even more powerful than Wei Wubing's because of the Emperor qi within its bones. In fact, its combat strength would even surpass his.
Nonetheless, since he had personally carved the formation on the War Body, he would naturally be able to control it.
Fifteen minutes later.
The little worm grew accustomed to its new body.
"I feel stronger than I ever have before," it said with an excited howl.
The large White-boned Earth Dragon moved around the quiet room. All its bones were perfectly joined and its movements became less awkward. It was like a machine that gradually ran more smoothly after it had completed the initial warm-up phase. The power it exuded grew more and more powerful because the little worm was still unable to completely grasp the formation within the bones. It would need time to adapt to its new body before it would be able to rein in its power.
"I feel like I can tear the heavens and earth apart," it yelled excitedly.
"Shut up." Ye Qingyu was afraid that this worm might tear down the Heaven Wasteland Building in all its excitement. "I'll destroy this War Body if you ever dare to defy me and also kill you at the same time. I can give you this body, but at the same time, I'm able to completely destroy you."
The little worm was so frightened that it immediately calmed down.
It respected and feared Ye Qingyu, no longer daring to show any sign of defiance.
"I want you to first grow accustomed to your body. You'll get a chance to show off your skills in a few days. I hope you won't let me down then," he instructed the worm. Then, he kept the White-boned Earth Dragon in the storage space of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] in order to prevent it from causing alarm and chaos outside.
Soon after, the Great Dragon Turtle Demon knocked on the door.
"My lord, we're approaching the Domain Gate. It is time," the Great Dragon Turtle Demon reported.
Ye Qingyu nodded and left the quiet room.
Four hours laterâ€”
He left Heaven Connect City and appeared in the Dragon Human Domain.
The Dragon Human Domain had been thrown into turmoil and war since the dissolution of the Dragonblood Dynasty. It was extremely chaotic, and a large majority of the domain gates were controlled by the major forces and were under military control, so they could not be used. Therefore, the Domain Gate that he used was an extremely small Domain Gate located at the border of the wilderness. He emerged from that domain gate and entered a small city located along that border.
A mix of humans and Dragon Humans resided in the city.
This small city was in a very chaotic state since the Dragon Human Race army was recruiting soldiers. The Dragonblood Dynasty had split into three branches and war broke out frequently, so the Dragon Human Race experts weren't the only ones who were recruited. Many young men of the Human Race were also forced to join the army as cannon fodder to perform the lowliest tasks, and they were treated like laborers. The sounds of cries and wails filled the entire city as the houses of many humans were set on fire.
In such a chaotic world, the men were treated worse than dogs.

The White-boned Earth Dragon opened its mouth and the air vibrated in its throat as it forced an almost unintelligible voice out of its newfound body.
"My body. Iâ€¦" The little worm was clearly not used to its new body and it was overcome by a strange sensation, as though it were a newborn child. The moment it moved its body, it fell on the ground with a loud bang.
"You should take some time to get used to it," Ye Qingyu said patiently.
The little worm would need a bit of time to adapt to its new body, but it was the perfect candidate to control this War Body because Puppet Bloodworms only had souls but lacked bodies. This worm was like Wei Wubing, so after it grew accustomed to its body, its combat strength would be even more powerful than Wei Wubing's because of the Emperor qi within its bones. In fact, its combat strength would even surpass his.
Nonetheless, since he had personally carved the formation on the War Body, he would naturally be able to control it.
Fifteen minutes later.
The little worm grew accustomed to its new body.
"I feel stronger than I ever have before," it said with an excited howl.
The large White-boned Earth Dragon moved around the quiet room. All its bones were perfectly joined and its movements became less awkward. It was like a machine that gradually ran more smoothly after it had completed the initial warm-up phase. The power it exuded grew more and more powerful because the little worm was still unable to completely grasp the formation within the bones. It would need time to adapt to its new body before it would be able to rein in its power.
"I feel like I can tear the heavens and earth apart," it yelled excitedly.
"Shut up." Ye Qingyu was afraid that this worm might tear down the Heaven Wasteland Building in all its excitement. "I'll destroy this War Body if you ever dare to defy me and also kill you at the same time. I can give you this body, but at the same time, I'm able to completely destroy you."
The little worm was so frightened that it immediately calmed down.
It respected and feared Ye Qingyu, no longer daring to show any sign of defiance.
"I want you to first grow accustomed to your body. You'll get a chance to show off your skills in a few days. I hope you won't let me down then," he instructed the worm. Then, he kept the White-boned Earth Dragon in the storage space of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] in order to prevent it from causing alarm and chaos outside.
Soon after, the Great Dragon Turtle Demon knocked on the door.
"My lord, we're approaching the Domain Gate. It is time," the Great Dragon Turtle Demon reported.
Ye Qingyu nodded and left the quiet room.
Four hours laterâ€”
He left Heaven Connect City and appeared in the Dragon Human Domain.
The Dragon Human Domain had been thrown into turmoil and war since the dissolution of the Dragonblood Dynasty. It was extremely chaotic, and a large majority of the domain gates were controlled by the major forces and were under military control, so they could not be used. Therefore, the Domain Gate that he used was an extremely small Domain Gate located at the border of the wilderness. He emerged from that domain gate and entered a small city located along that border.
A mix of humans and Dragon Humans resided in the city.
This small city was in a very chaotic state since the Dragon Human Race army was recruiting soldiers. The Dragonblood Dynasty had split into three branches and war broke out frequently, so the Dragon Human Race experts weren't the only ones who were recruited. Many young men of the Human Race were also forced to join the army as cannon fodder to perform the lowliest tasks, and they were treated like laborers. The sounds of cries and wails filled the entire city as the houses of many humans were set on fire.
In such a chaotic world, the men were treated worse than dogs.

Chapter 1059:


Chapter 1074 - Men Were Treated like Ants in Times of Chaos
Since Ye Qingyu was part of the Human Race, he would also be targeted by the Dragon Human soldiers.
However, he was so strong that as long as he didn't want to be captured, those Dragon Human soldiers weren't able to spot him even if he was right under their noses.
This small city had already descended into utter chaos.
The corpses of the various races were scattered all over the streets and the Human Race made up the majority of these corpses. The Dragon Human Domain was a multiracial domain but it was governed solely by the Dragon Human Race. It was rumored that this domain was formed from the remains of a divine Dragon King after his death. Thereafter, the first Dragon Humans appeared in this domain. They looked exactly the same as the Human Race but they had dragon horns that grew on their heads and they were born with the aura of the Dragon Race, so they were innately powerful.
"Don't let him get awayâ€¦"
Footsteps pounded ahead.
Six Dragon Human soldiers were in pursuit of a young man of the Human Race.
That young man was barely clothed and he looked a little malnourished as he stumbled down the streets. He was injured and didn't look where he was headed in his moment of panic, so he was cornered in a dead end. His face filled with fear and despair.
"I'm going to fight all of you to the deathâ€¦" that young man howled madly. "You captured my parents, then my brothers and sisters who all died in the army camp. I'd rather die than be a dog serving you Dragon Humans!"
"Ha ha haâ€¦."
The Dragon Human soldiers laughed loudly.
"The Human Race is already doomedâ€¦ even your spokesperson is already dead."
"The Prime Minister wants to launch an attack on the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland Domain and all of you human parasites have been living on our land and feeding off our resources. It is time for you humans to use your lowly lives to pay back what you've gained from our domain."
The Dragon Human soldier who spoke was more muscular than an ordinary Human.
These Dragon Human soldiers were all clad in armor and were of Spirit Spring Stage cultivation. They looked savage and ferocious as they cornered that young man who had only attained the first body cultivation stage and toyed with him like a cat teasing a mouse.
"I'll fight all of you to the deathâ€¦" the young man rushed at them like a madman when he realized that he was trapped in a hopeless situation.
"Humph, how dare you defy our orders. Break his legs and bring him back to camp to feed the wolves," the leader of the group of Dragon Human soldiers said with a cold smirk.
A Dragon Human soldier charged out extremely quickly.
His body surged with powerful strength.
That young man was already sent flying by that soldier's energy waves even before he managed to reach the Dragon Human soldiers. He crashed against the wall and blood spurted from his mouth. He lost his will to fight and slumped despairingly against the wall with his eyes closed.
"Dad, mum, brothers and sisters, I'll be joining you soon enoughâ€¦" he muttered to himself in defeat.
However, the intense pain he had expected did not come.
Several breaths later, that young man opened his eyes in confusion.
To his disbelief, he saw that those Dragon Human soldiers were already knocked out and lay motionless on the ground like dead dogs. A young warrior who was clad in a long white robe looked at him with a smile.
He was really handsome.
This was that young man's first thought when he saw that warrior. Not a single speck of dirt got on that warrior and his robes and he was so bright that he seemed completely unlike that humans who lived in the Dragon Human Domain. At the very least, that young man had never seen a Human Race who was so clean throughout the entire Dragon Human Domain that he resembled a nobleman.
"Are you alright?" the young warrior asked.
"Ah, Iâ€¦ am fineâ€¦" the young man stuttered out. He looked carefully at that warrior and realized that the young warrior was truly of the Human Race and relaxed slightly when he didn't see any dragon horns on the warrior's head. He felt that this young warrior exuded an authority that he couldn't put into words. Even the Dragon Human City Lord of this small city didn't seem as authoritative as that young warrior.
"Who are you?" the young man asked after he had calmed down.
He could already guess that this young warrior was his savior who knocked those Dragon Human soldiers out.
"My last name is Ye. You may call me Ye Qingyu," the young warrior said with a smile. His smile seemed so warm that the young man found that he was suddenly no longer afraid.
"Iâ€¦ I'm Hao Jianren. Iâ€¦" The young man was still a little awkward around him but suddenly grew anxious at the thought of something and urged him, "Quick, we've got to get out of here. The Dragon Human Race have been capturing the humans and they want to round up all the humans in this city. The elderly, women and children have all become food for their wolves while the healthy men are made to be laborers and cannon fodderâ€¦"
Ye Qingyu nodded, "I know. You should come with me."
This city wasn't very big so after Ye Qingyu released his divine sense, he immediately grasped all that was unfolding throughout the city. He brought Hao Jianren around the city with him and soon rescued many humans who were pursued by the Dragon Race soldiers. Then, he went to the manor of the City Lord and rescued all the humans who were held captive within. The cruel deeds that were done to the humans in the City Lord's manor enraged Ye Qingyu so much that he wiped out all the Dragon Humans in the manor.
Hao Jianren was completely flabbergasted.
He had never imagined that such a powerful Human Race warrior could exist in this universe.
Who exactly was this young warrior who called himself Ye Qingyu?
Hao Jianren wondered curiously.
After he rescued all those humans, he brought them to a safe place, then he went to the military camp stationed outside the city.
"Lord Ye Qingyu, are you really going to barge in there?" Hao Jianren asked worriedly. "This military camp is many times more frightening than the City Lord's manor. There were true Dragon Human Race experts in this place and they're the regular troops from the Dragon Scale Province. There are more than a thousand soldiers insideâ€¦ You must think twice before you act."
Ye Qingyu smiled but didn't say anything else.
He walked toward the gates of the military camp.
Hao Jianren felt his legs give way, but he ultimately decided to follow him.
"Halt! Who's there?" The Dragon Human soldier on duty at the lookout post asked as he spotted them. He noticed that they were humans soon after and immediately shot two large arrows toward them with the intent to kill.
Hao Jianren shut his eyes in fear.
Ye Qingyu sent the arrows flying back at lightning speed toward these soldiers with a casual flick of his hand and those two Dragon Human soldiers on sentry duty were immediately shot down from the lookout post. The lookout post that was more than 20 meters tall was also shot through by the arrows and collapsed.
"Enemy attack!"
A sharp bugle call and cries of rage could be heard from the military camp.
Ye Qingyu had already smashed open the doors to the military camp and entered with his companion.
Then, he went on a killing rampage within the camp and crushed the large Dragon Human Race army as easily as though he was scything weeds.
He saw many elderly and young humans who have been cruelly killed and their corpses were shredded by knives to be made into food for their wolves. There were also several humans who were still alive and were tied to wooden posts. Their legs and hands had been hacked off to feed the steeds of the Dragon Human military officials. These humans had been cruelly tortured and were in immense painâ€¦
He saw more than five thousand Â laborers and cannon fodder in this military camp and these people were barely clothed and were severely emaciated. Most of these laborers and cannon fodders were of the Human Race while a small minority were from the foreign races.
"Whoâ€¦ Who are you?" The commanding officer of this military camp stumbled around and his face was full of despair and fear. This human who barged into their military camp was unbelievably strong and had wiped out their entire thousand-strong army in less than fifteen minutes.
Ye Qingyu reached out and the Dragon Human commanding officer sailed across the sky and into his clutches.
His divine sense ruthlessly invaded the commanding officer's mind.
Soon, he browsed through all the information contained in the commanding officer's memories.
"A plan to exterminate the race? They're planning to completely wipe out the Human Race from the Dragon Human Domain. The ruler of the Dragon Scale Province, Xu Xuesheng must be out of his mindâ€¦" his eyes shone brightly.
He gathered from this commanding officer's memories that the ruler of the Dragon Scale Province was an elder of the Dragonblood Dynasty and part of the royal family. This ruler had decreed that all the humans who lived in the Dragon Scale Province must be exterminated and ordered his men to use them as food for their steeds or cannon fodder.
The Dragon Human Domain was in a state of anarchy since the Dragonblood Dynasty lost its ruling power. The rulers of the major provinces fought fiercely for land and resources so it was extremely chaotic and three major camps had emerged. The first was the imperial family of the Dragonblood Dynasty. Its power might have been diminished but its influence still remained so it ruled over large swathes of land and were still very powerful. The second was the Dragonblood Army led by their War God, Xu Wuya who occupied several cities of strategic importance while the third camp was an alliance formed by many elders of the Dragonblood Dynasty together with the officials and governors of the various provinces and lands at the frontier who wanted to completely overthrow the Dragonblood Dynasty to form a new order.
Besides these three major camps, there were other camps of varying sizes who also occupied some territory that launched many fierce attacks on each other.
The Dragon Humans were also suffering immensely in this world of chaos, so the humans who were regarded as lower-class citizens under the ruling power fared even worse. This was especially true for territories that were under those who bore extreme hatred toward the Human Race like the ruler of the Dragon Scale Province Xu Xuesheng. He was an elderly Dragon Human who had lived for thousands of years and was someone who felt very strongly about the extermination of the Human Race throughout the Dragon Human Domain.
He shook himself out of his reverie and returned to the small city.
He laid out a formation in the city to protect the surviving humans.
"Everything will change here soon. As long as you don't leave this city, you should be safe here for many months," he told these people. Then, he turned to Hao Jianren and said, "Don't tell anyone my name, do you understand?"
Hao Jianren quickly nodded.
Ye Qingyu realized that despite the chaotic situation of the Dragon Human Domain, the true men of influence within the domain would definitely be very well-informed and might have already received news about the events at the Alliance of Domains mourning hall. If they knew of his arrival at the Dragon Human Domain, they would definitely flee and go into hiding so it would be very hard to find them all one at a time. He was also worried that those who plotted to murder Ren Puyang might have sensed that something was wrong and gone even deeper into hiding.
Therefore, he had to hide his identity for the time being.
After he made the necessary arrangements for these humans, he turned to leave.
"Lord, my lordâ€¦" Hao Jianren ran after him and asked breathlessly, "My lord, where are you off to?"
"Hidden Dragon City," he answered.
Hidden Dragon City was a large city within the Dragon Scale Province and was considered to be among the top fifty largest cities of the Dragon Human Domain.
"My lord, couldâ€¦ you bring me along with you?" Hao Jianren asked. "I've been to Hidden Dragon City with my father and know a bit about the place. I've also heard of several Human Race experts within the city and might able to contact them when we're there. They might just be able to help you."
He looked hopefully at Ye Qingyu.
After the events earlier, Hao Jianren could tell that Ye Qingyu was a highly-skilled warrior and he wanted to remain by Ye Qingyu's side. He'd be happy to help Ye Qingyu, no matter how minor it might be, and also hoped to learn something from Ye Qingyu so that he wouldn't be at the mercy of the Dragon Humans in the future. Then, he would be able to protect his family and friends.
He knew that if he missed this opportunity, he would probably not have another chance for the rest of his life.
He was extremely nervous after he made his request.
Ye Qingyu looked at him and seemed a little hesitant.
Chapter 1074 - Men Were Treated like Ants in Times of Chaos

Since Ye Qingyu was part of the Human Race, he would also be targeted by the Dragon Human soldiers.

Chapter 1060:


Chapter 1075 â€“ Zhou Yuexin


He ultimately nodded in assent after he saw the look in Hao Jianren's eyes.

"Many thanks, my lord. Many thanksâ€¦" Hao Jianren was overcome with joy.

Hidden Dragon City was approximately ten thousand kilometers away from this small chaotic city, but Ye Qingyu was so powerful that he could travel this distance in a flash.

He immediately made his way past the guards at the city gates and appeared in a quiet alley in the city.

"I can smell the scent of blood," Hao Jianren said in surprise and fear.

Ye Qingyu remained silent.

In fact, the scent of blood wafted through the entire city. The city was extremely large, even larger than Snow Capital of Heaven Wasteland Domain, but it was very chaotic, even more so than the small city. He could see many human corpses that had been abandoned on the streets. The humans seemed to be treated even worse than dogs and pigs in this city.

Signs of chaos and panic could be seen throughout the city.

Those in the Human Race in this city were treated more miserably than in the small city.

"Master, this place feels a little familiar," the Puppet Bloodworm said telepathically. "I'm sure that Wei Wubing was here when he was alive."

He was overjoyed.

That was enough to prove several things.

As he mulled over the bloodworm's statement, they exited the small alley.

The roads were very wide but the atmosphere was bleak, and the few passers-by who walked on the roads looked very anxious and flustered. Regardless of whether they were from the Dragon Human Race, Human Race, or from another race, everyone seemed very twitchy and afraid.

The high-rise shops located on both sides of the road were almost all owned by the Dragon Human Race. Hidden Dragon City was strictly governed and the foreign races were all considered lower-class citizens, so it was extremely difficult for them to own shops located on such prime land.

Several Dragon People in those shops looked at Ye Qingyu and Hao Jianren curiously and whispered amongst themselves because they were the only humans who walked on the streets and they both seemed so relaxed.

"I don't see a single human. It is as though they've all completely disappeared," Hao Jianren said fearfully.

Ye Qingyu remained silent.

He released his divine sense in search of something.

Suddenly, they heard the sounds of hurried footsteps ahead.

"Catch those two humans. Don't let them get away..." Several dozen Dragon Human Race warriors rushed toward them. These warriors all held weapons and were clad in blood-colored armor, looking extremely fierce.

"What should we do?" Hao Jianren was starting to panic.

After all, they were in Hidden Dragon City, where there were many Dragon Human Race experts.

Ye Qingyu did not respond.

Soon after, they were completely surrounded by the Dragon Human Race warriors.

"Take them away," the Dragon Human Race warrior who was their leader commanded.

Clang!

Chains were placed over both their heads.

"Don't resist," Ye Qingyu said in Hao Jianren's ear.

Hao Jianren froze, then he obediently stopped trying to resist being captured.

The Dragon Human Race warriors dragged them both away.

They were led out of the streets and stuffed into a prisoner's cart. Fifteen minutes later, the cart arrived in front of a high-rise manor with a large yard. The words "Commander's Residence" were written on a plaque on the main doors and it was heavily guarded. The gates opened and their prisoner's cart was pushed into the manor.

The prisoner's cart passed the main courtyard and was led down winding paths, passing by a military practice ground before finally arriving in the backyard.

"We're here."

The leader of the Dragon Human Race warriors unlocked the prisoner's cart and released both Ye Qingyu and Hao Jianren. Then, he removed the chains around their necks and said with a frown, "What were the two of you thinking? Hmm? Don't you know that humans are being hunted down all across the city? How could you walk on the streets in broad daylight? Are you trying to court death?"

He sounded as though he was admonishing them but there was even a trace of concern in his voice.

Hao Jianren was extremely confused.

Ye Qingyu remained calm and maintained his silence.

"Alright, all the others are being held in the backyard. Go on in and remain quietly inside. Don't go anywhere else... Our mistress is a kind soul who is willing to brave the danger to save the Human Race. If you run around rashly despite my warning, you deserve to die." The leader left them with a warning and instructed his men to lead both Ye Qingyu and Hao Jianren into a quiet courtyard in the backyard.

"Stay here quietly and stop running around. You were both ridiculously brash today," the Dragon Human Race warrior warned them again. "Don't get my mistress into trouble."

They were led into the courtyard.

To their surprise, they discovered that there were many humans residing in the courtyard, filling the entire courtyard to the brim. Everyone turned to stare at them when they were led inside.

"Oh, they rescued another two humans."

"Miss Yuexin is really kind..."

All these humans immediately surrounded the newcomers and clamored to ask, "Where did you guys come from? What's the situation outside?"

Hao Jianren looked at Ye Qingyu, and after Ye Qingyu gave him a small nod, he told the others what he had seen on the streets earlier.

"What? The two of you dared to walk down the main streets in broad daylight? Wow, you were really courting death. Fortunately, Miss Yuexin managed to rescue you in time and you managed to escape with your lives," a middle-aged man who seemed to be in his thirties exclaimed in shock.

"I didn't expect the situation in Hidden Dragon City to be so terrible that not a single person of the Human Race could be seen on the streets," an elderly man said sadly.

Ye Qingyu took a look around his surroundings.

This courtyard was only about twenty thousand to twenty-seven thousand square meters, and it had both pavilions and waterside pavilions. It looked like it was a little dilapidated and it was currently being used as their hiding place. There were almost ten thousand humans in this courtyard and they looked rather healthy. No one had been tortured and it did not seem like they had been captured as cannon fodder either.

Hao Jianren had already befriended several humans and tried to find out more from them.

Suddenly, the doors to the courtyard opened.

"Time to eat."

Several dozen Dragon Human warriors entered with buns and congee.

All the humans in the courtyard lined up in an orderly manner and collected their rations.

A while later, Hao Jianren approached Ye Qingyu and reported the news he had gathered.

"This is the residence of Zhou Tingyu, the commander of the Destroyer Army, one of the three main standing armies in Dragon Scale Province. The 'Miss Zhou' that everyone mentioned earlier is the only daughter of Marshal Zhou and she's known to be one of the four beauties of Hidden Dragon City. It is said that she's extremely gorgeous and innately talented, so she is very popular. She cares for the Human Race and took great risks to save many humans when they were being captured throughout the cityâ€¦"

Hao Jianren shared all the information he had gleaned from the others.

Not everyone from the Dragon Human Race was evil and savage, there were still kind souls amongst them.

Ye Qingyu nodded.

His impression of the Dragon Human Race improved a little after he heard this news.

Unfortunately, Zhou Yuexin could not single-handedly save all the humans within the city.

Suddenly, a cheer broke out in the crowd.

"Miss Yuexin has arrived."

"Greetings, Miss Yuexin."

Ye Qingyu turned to look in the direction of the cheers.

He saw a beautiful woman in a purple-gold dragon armor escorted by several handsome female warriors. As she entered the courtyard, Ye Qingyu's eyes lit up. He did not expect such an ethereal and beautiful woman to be from the Dragon Human Race. She looked more petite than an average Dragon Human; her skin was as fair as snow, her features were gorgeous and well-defined, her brows were black and sharp, and her eyes shone brightly like black crystals. She was also very slender and her long crimson hair was like a fiery flame, which added to her bold charm.

She was indeed a rare beauty.

Her cultivation was probably around the peak Immortal Step realm. Although this was nothing compared with his own cultivation, she would indeed be considered very powerful amongst her peers to have attained this cultivation at such a young age.

This was the person whose name was on everyone's lipsâ€”Zhou Yuexin.

She was a kind-hearted woman who greeted everyone and even gave some sweets to the children. Her laugh was melodious as she said some words of comfort to the humans. "Don't worry. Everyone at the Commander's residence will do our best to protect all of youâ€¦ There aren't many within Hidden Dragon City who would dare to barge into our residence."

Everyone cheered.

However, Ye Qingyu noticed that her eyes were slightly clouded with worry. Clearly, the situation was not as simple as she tried to make it seem.

"You must be the ones who have just joined us today, right?" Zhou Yuexin noticed Ye Qingyu and greeted him with a smile. His white robes and extraordinary aura made him stand out from the rest of the humans.

"Many thanks for saving my life," Ye Qingyu saluted her with a smile.

Zhou Yuexin smiled and her eyes curved prettily like crescent moons along with it. "You're welcome. A human once saved my life, so this is the least I could do to repay his kindnessâ€¦" She looked at Ye Qingyu and noticed that he did not give off any yuan qi aura, and his companion, Hao Jianren, only had an above average blood qi, so she assumed that he was a nobleman and Hao Jianren was his servant and did not pay them much attention.

After she reassured the humans, Zhou Yuexin left.

Ye Qingyu looked at her departing figure contemplatively.

"Sigh. Miss Yuexin is truly a kind-hearted soul. She must be under a lot of pressure because of us," said someone in the crowd.

"That's right. She is beautiful and kind-hearted and also extraordinarily talented. No wonder the strongest human of the younger generation here, Guo Wuyan, is in love with her and they've pledged themselves to each other in private. It was rumored that if it wasn't for the chaos that broke out throughout the Dragon Human Domain this time, he would've already eloped with her."

"The Dragon Human Race have always thought that they were of a noble bloodline and forbade inter-marriage between Dragon People and humans, so their relationship will not be accepted here in this domain. Sigh, the stars seem to be conspiring against this pair of lovers."

"Miss Yuexin is truly in love with him and has remained true to him. I heard rumors that many young, handsome, and influential Dragon People have sought her hand in marriage but she rejected them all."

The crowd engaged in animated discussion.

It was clear that everyone was both sympathetic to her plight and admired her.

Ye Qingyu sank into deep thought.

He was surprised to hear about her plight.

An idea came to him and he telepathically reminded Hao Jianren to remain where he was. Then, he silently disappeared on the spot and no one noticed him leaving.

"Miss, miss, there's trouble. The men from the Fugitive Recovery Unit have come again."

A maid ran toward her in a panic.

Zhou Yuexin's brows arched as she said, "Didn't we just send them away? Why are they back? Do they really have the guts to barge into our manor? These people are getting bolder and more impudent."

"Xu Tiexin from the Fugitive Recovery Unit has personally led his men here. He said that he was acting on Prince Xu Xuesheng's orders to search the manor," the maid said breathlessly. "The commander informed me to let you know immediately and asked you to think of a way to send all these humans away as soon as possible. We might not be able to protect them otherwise."

"What?"

Zhou Yuexin immediately turned pale.

Was the situation already so serious?
