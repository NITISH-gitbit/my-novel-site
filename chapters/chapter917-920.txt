Chapter 917:


Chapter 934 – Dramatic Transformation of the Clear River




In the reply letter, Ye Qingyu expressed his gratitude but declined Tang Chong’s goodwill.

These were eventful times, with Ren Puyang and another white-robed divine guard, Xiao Lin, missing in action. For the time being, Tang Chong was Ye Qingyu’s most powerful ally at the Alliance of Domains. Ye Qingyu did not wish for the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s issue to cause Tang Chong to be flayed by political rivals at the Alliance and thereby endanger Tang Chong’s status. After all, Tang Chong was most useful to him by remaining as the commander of the white-robed divine guards.

Ye Qingyu sat in quiet contemplation after writing the reply letter.

For some reason, although the situation seemed all-good at present, Ye Qingyu had a nagging feeling that a storm was coming. Every now and then, he would shudder with fear, as if the “sudden inspiration” of some time ago was repeatedly re-occurring.

What exactly is wrong?

For a time, Ye Qingyu was unable to figure it out.

“The overall situation and internal conditions of the Heaven Wasteland Domain have all been stabilized. Although the message from the Immortal God Court states that everything is fine in the Clear River Domain, the figures of Bai Yuanxing and the others have been continually popping up in my mind. Could something have changed in the Clear River Domain? I should pay it a visit as soon as I can.”

This was his conclusion after thinking back and forth.

Subsequently, he went into self-isolation again.

Before heading to the Clear River Domain, he had to make full use of the remaining time to sum up and reflect on his recent comprehension, and make progress on the [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra] by perfecting and integrating his small accomplishment in it. He had a feeling that this trip to the Clear River Domain would not be straightforward.

As he operated the nameless breathing technique, his inner yuan surged.

Like a meditating monk, he sat with his eyes closed and his face calm and peaceful.

In extremely beautiful fashion, wisps of sword will and qi, each no more than a meter in length, expanded and contracted in Ye Qingyu’s body like a peacock flaunting its tail. At first, they seemed to be varying in length and disorderly, but as time passed, they became as sparkling and clear as ice crystals, and their lengths became completely uniform. They expanded and contracted with perfect rhythm, while their gleaming radiance made Ye Qingyu look as awe-inspiring as a white-robed deity king.

Three days passed in a twinkling.

The sword radiance that lingered around Ye Qingyu slowly entered his body.

He was not yet done cultivating. Opening his mouth to spit out a beam of ice qi, he remained in meditation as the yuan qi in his body surged like a giant tide. During these days of cultivating the [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra], his inner yuan was relatively less condensed than before, and so he had to operate his qi and regulate his condition.

Another three days passed just like that.

He gradually readjusted his condition to its optimum.

His sword will blended perfectly and his inner yuan surged.

Just as he was about to end this cultivation session, an intense stream of consciousness suddenly pervaded the Void, seeming extremely far away yet right in front of his eyes at the same time. As his heart jolted, he raised a hand and tore the Void. He then opened his palm and grabbed hold of a trace of spiritual wave.

Using his divine consciousness to probe it slightly, he was able to extract the information contained within.

“Huh? This is...”

An unclear image appeared in his mind. There were collapsing mountains and reverse-flowing rivers, while the mountain gate of some large sect was bombarded by beams of giant cannon flowing light. As the ground shook, a rift was torn in the sky, with smoke and the wails of countless beings filling the air. This was a war scene. Under the heavy bombardment, the figures of numerous experts successively turned into flying ash, accompanied by human roars which sounded like that of the howls of despairing beasts...

Where is this?

Ye Qingyu felt uncertain.

He had never seen such a mountain gate and such a scene, and had never visited the place of this scene before.

“How did a trace of consciousness like this manage to get my attention and be grabbed hold of in the Void? This is really strange...” He wondered if his sudden inspirations these days were a result of this wisp of consciousness. The problem, however, was that none of it seemed to have any relation to him.

After some contemplation, he carefully re-examined the information contained in this trace of consciousness.

This time, he quickly discovered a few clues.

“That’s…
that
symbol. Isn’t it the Immortal God Emperor Sect’s?”

He unexpectedly discovered a few rather-familiar patterns and signs on the battle garments of a few desperately fighting and struggling figures. On careful examination, these patterns were very similar to those he had seen on Nan Tieyi, the successor of the Immortal God Emperor Sect, as well as Ling Xiaoran and Heng Yuge who together managed South Facing Inn in Flowing Light City and once fought alongside him.

He was deeply astonished as he thought about this.

Could the image in this consciousness be depicting the process of the Immortal God Emperor Sect’s Mountain Gate being breached?

That’s impossible. I’ve always maintained contact with the Immortal God Emperor Sect, and last contacted them three months ago. The feedback from them was that they’re beginning to obtain a dominant position in the Clear River Domain and are vigorously regaining their former glory. There are no other forces in the entire Clear River Domain which can compete with them. How can anyone breach their mountain gate and put them in such a difficult position when they command such a great advantage?

What’s going on?

Standing up, he began to worry.

“It looks like I have to bring forward my trip to the Clear River Domain.”

He had made up his mind.

A day later.

In the Clear River Domain.

Ye Qingyu was standing upright on a barren hill.

It had been half a day since he traveled through the Domain Gate and officially reached the Clear River Domain.

When he departed those years back, the Immortal God Emperor Sect had already taken a firm hold of the post-war situation. According to the incoming letters of a year later, the Clear River Domain was gradually being restored and unified, with the Immortal God Emperor sect serving as the main power and other Human Race sects serving as support.

Therefore, he had thought that the Clear River Domain was set to become a peaceful and safe domain.

But instead, today’s happenings completely went beyond his expectations.

Everything had changed.

The entire domain was riddled with the flames of war and was in a state of utter chaos. In the past half a day, Ye Qingyu had traveled tens of thousands of kilometers but did not see a single sign of stability and peace. On the contrary, everywhere was covered in the smoke of war, and many historical cities had been turned into ruins. The smell of blood and death lingered in the sky, with many mountains already collapsed and large stretches of plains turned into deserts, and an aura of destruction lingered in the Void. These were signs of a large war between experts.

Moreover, while on his way, Ye Qingyu had seen countless fleeing people who were displaced from their homes. As the saying goes, ‘it is better to be a dog in peaceful times than a human in troubled times’. Indeed, in such troubled times, human life was about as valuable as that of crickets and ants, while bandits and ferocious beasts were everywhere. The beings of various large races were in a state of despair, yet it was apparently the Human Race which was the most miserable of the lot. Like ants in a stream of water, they could perish ignobly at any time.

Subject to such chaos, several forces which were originally of an orderly nature began acting unwisely and fought against one another with extreme bloodlust.

Order completely disappeared.

Chaos shrouded the world.

After half a day’s time, Ye Qingyu had finally found out the root of all this chaos…

The Greater One Sect.

The Greater One Sect again.

For some reason, the Greater One Sect had incredibly and mysteriously managed to rise up again after the war of the Storm Sword Duel gathering, when it had looked completely done for. Displaying immense power and using thunderous methods, it terrorized all. Its army, made up of disciples and several thousand powerful experts of mysterious origins, swept irresistibly throughout and wiped out countless sects within the domain, all while doing things in an extremely cruel and terrifying fashion.

Various large and illustrious sects, including the Starry Heaven Palace, the Dark Martial Sect, the Spiritual Platform Hall, and the Tempest Pavilion, were unable to survive.

It could be said that there was not a single survivor among all the sects which were affected by the massacre carried out by the Greater One Sect’s army.

Within just half a year’s time, the entire Clear River Domain was already trembling under the oppression caused by the Greater One Sect’s army. Every surviving sect had retreated to the mountains, where they sealed themselves up. All large cities and towns had thus fallen under the control of the Greater One Sect.

Before he had arrived, Ye Qingyu had guessed that it should be a foreign domain force which could threaten the might of the Immortal God Emperor Sect. Now, however, he realized that the force which terrorized the Immortal God Emperor Sect, as well as the true power in the Clear River Domain, was none other than the Greater One Sect!

How can this be?

He could not understand how.

This allowed him to realize that the situation was not as positive as he had expected. Thinking in association to the wisp of consciousness which he had sensed, he wondered if the mountain gate of the Immortal God Emperor Sect had indeed been breached by the mysterious army of the Greater One Sect.

He could not help feeling anxious.

What exactly has happened?

I must hurry to the Wei River Mountain Range, where the mountain gate of the Immortal God Emperor Sect is, to find out.

Problem is, I don’t know where this mountain range is.

As he pondered, he suddenly seemed to detect something. As his eyes flashed, two beams of indistinct purple lightning flickered out of his eyes and shot several kilometers away.

Several kilometers away.

A continuous stretch of giant shadows slowly swept across the mountain ridges and wastelands.

It was dozens of giant formation battleships traveling among the clouds with an impressive vigor. Large flags fluttered in the wind, making whistling sounds.

Huh?

The symbol on those flags is…

Ye Qingyu fixed his sights.

He discovered that the flags on the giant warships had a unique lotus-patterned symbol which he had seen in the Greater One Sect before.

Are these the warships of the Greater One Sect?

How did they come to possess such overpowering warships?

He was bewildered.

The warships traveling above the clouds were powerful and domineering, containing sufficient divine power and light-energy cannonballs to rival the firepower of the giant warships used by the Black Moon Divine Palace during the battle of the chaotic windstorms.

Although the Greater One Sect had deployed warships during the battle of the Storm Platform many years ago, the power of those warships was far inferior to that of these irresistible ones. Moreover, Ye Qingyu knew clearly that, given the strength of the Greater One Sect back then, there was absolutely no way they could have created warships of this level.

Chapter 918:


Chapter 935 – An Old Acquaintance Dies in Flowing Light City (1)
Ye Qingyu turned his sights toward the hulls and decks of several warships and examined them carefully.
He could vaguely see that on the deck of every warship were nearly one hundred disciples wearing the sect’s uniform and armored warriors, with the weakest among them at the preliminary Heaven Ascension realm. This more so made him feel puzzled as to how the strength of the Greater One Sect’s disciples had improved so rapidly within only two to three years of time. Moreover, those foreboding armored warriors appeared highly mysterious and were full of evil spirit. He firmly believed that it was impossible for the Greater One Sect to train a brigade like this in such a short time.
Could some mysterious force be secretly assisting the Greater One Sect?
He harbored suspicions without end.
After dozens of warships swept by, thousands of mutated spiritual birds which gave off specks of strange aura scurried out of the clouds. They had the body shapes of giant eagles, and every one of them was at least a hundred meters in length. Blood-colored rays of light flickered indistinctly in their dark-green eyes, as if they were under the control of some power. Possessing a terrifying aura, they flapped their wings as they slowly proceeded in the same direction as the warships, letting out shrilling and terrifying cries every now and then. Their close following of the warships suggested that they were the latter’s winged guards.
By Ye Qingyu’s estimation, the total combat strength of these mutated spiritual birds was even more frightening than that of the dozens of warships.
The problem was, Ye Qingyu did not remember the Greater One Sect ever having a method of manipulating spiritual birds.
Everything was all too strange.
Seems like I must first find out what happened in the Clear River Domain during this period of time.
Ye Qingyu did not pursue the warship contingent, for he could discern that this was just a small section rather than the main force of the Greater One Sect’s army. As such, he would not only be unable to find out anything from them but would also end up alerting the enemy. After thinking it over, he decided to proceed to Flowing Light City first and find Heng Yuge, Ling Xiaoran, and Chen Zhengliang at the South Facing Inn. He hoped to find out the truth of the matter from them before rushing to the Wei River Mountain Range, where he would be able to see if the horrific scene in that wisp of consciousness had actually taken place.
With a thought, he instantly disappeared on the spot.
An hour later.
In front of the gate tower of Flowing Light City.
Ye Qingyu’s figure emerged.
The lofty, giant gate and walls of Flowing Light City had already been repaired. The giant stone bulwarks looked grand and imposing, such that there was no sign of them ever being damaged by the flames of war. However, what surprised Ye Qingyu was that the flags which fluttered above the buildings had all been changed to the lotus totem flags of the Greater One Sect, while the armored guards patrolling the city were all wearing armlets with the symbol of said sect.
It appeared that Flowing Light City had been recaptured by the Greater One Sect.
This made Ye Qingyu feel uneasy.
Now that the Greater One Sect has regained control of this place, I wonder how Chen Zhengliang and the others are doing?
He followed the crowd and slowly headed toward the city gate.
Below the city gate.
“Everyone who wants to enter or leave has to be checked. Anyone who dares to resist and any wanted criminal discovered will be killed on the spot. Those who dare to cover up a wanted criminal are equally guilty!” A cold and merciless voice repeatedly sounded from a formation screen, which could cover half a wall, at the bottom section of the city wall. Like rolling thunder, it resounded across more than a hundred meters.
Wearing red-colored battle armor, a hundred Greater One Sect aces who sternly wielded knives and spears had set up a roadblock and were brutally yet carefully examining each and every person entering and exiting the city.
The passers-by all seemed to be in a hurry.
Because of the unrest caused by war, many refugees had come from a thousand kilometers away to Flowing Light City. Although this place had been seized by the Greater One Sect, it was nevertheless a guarded city and was thus free from bandits and vicious beasts. As such, it could be considered a relatively safe place where one would not meet a sudden end.
While standing among the refugees, Ye Qingyu discovered on close inspection that thousands of wanted criminals were listed on the giant formation screen. About seventy to eighty percent of them were experts of former large sects which had been destroyed by the Greater One Sect. Their family members had been killed while they had become exiles who wandered from place to place, hoping to strike back at the Greater One Sect. In addition, there were also some people akin to bandits and robbers listed. Their bounties varied according to their identities and strengths.
Moreover, this was not a fixed list, but rather one which was constantly updated.
Because of the thoroughness of the checks, entering the city took a long time. Ye Qingyu proceeded along with the queue and finally arrived below the city gate after nearly an hour. He officially stepped into the city after being subjected to checks by several guards.
He sensed an extremely strong smell of blood as soon as he entered the city.
He looked toward the left, where the smell of blood was coming from.
There was a forest of flag poles in the distance.
Hundreds of wooden flag poles of varying sizes stood erect over there.
These were the public execution stakes of Flowing Light City.
When the Demon Spider Race had occupied Flowing Light City at first, Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui had seen that these poles were hung with the corpses of the heroes who fought to defend the city. After recapturing the city, these corpses were given a proper burial by Chen Zhengliang and his men. When deputizing as the city lord, Chen Zhengliang had mentioned that these stakes were already ordered to be demolished.
Yet, these poles had reappeared at present.
They were hung with bloodstained heads.
Below them were piled thousands of corpses lying on a blood pool of more than ten meters. Because all of these people were martial experts, their bodies did not rot post-mortem and their blood did not congeal for the time being. Filled with rich yuan qi and aura, the blood pool rifled and rippled with a deadly and terrifying strangeness which caused one’s heart to tingle.
Ye Qingyu could tell that these envoys were mostly Human Race martial experts.
If he did not guess wrongly, these people were definitely important figures of various large sects who were killed by the Greater One Sect. Their corpses were displayed here after the fact as a warning to those who had rebellious intentions.
To think that, in order to build its authority, the Greater One Sect would act as evilly and cruelly as the Demon Spider Race.
Besides, as a foreign race, it’s within reason for the Demon Spider Race to do this kind of thing, as infuriating as it is. On the other hand, it would make more sense for the Greater One Sect, as a Human Race sect, to target foreign races for killing and suppressing. Instead, the beings which have died here are mostly humans. This shameless sect has perpetually placed priority on attacking its own kind. This is truly abominable.
A piercing chill flashed across his eyes.
Restraining the rage surging within his heart, he proceeded toward the South Facing Inn according to his memory.
The streets were bustling, with the shops on both sides still opened. There were also a few stalls of varying sizes, from which the peddlers’ hawking voices rose and fell in succession. Although it was not as lively as a few years ago when war had yet to break out, it was apparent that this giant city had gradually regained yuan qi and new life. Refugees crammed around the wall corners, every one of them looking miserable, hungry, and thirsty.
There was some vitality in Flowing Light City, so to speak.
However, this “vitality” was apparently being monitored and controlled by the Greater One Sect.
Aside from the three tight layers of checkpoints at the city gate, Ye Qingyu also saw along the way that there were two patrol teams in fire-red armor conducting inspections on every street. Everyone, be it the peddlers or the passers-by, revealed a tinge of fear and caution at the sight of them.
“I wonder how Chen Zhengliang is doing. When the Greater One Sect ruled Flowing Light City in the past, he was among the nobility of the city and could be considered a part of the Greater One Sect. Surely nothing bad could have happened to him.”
After pondering inwardly, Ye Qingyu turned and proceeded toward South Facing Inn.
After ten minutes.
In front of South Facing Inn.
Ye Qingyu stood quietly.
The red-painted door frame still gave off a faint smell of fresh paint, suggesting that it had recently been repainted. The exterior decoration, including a few symbolic designs, of the South Facing Inn had changed completely. Most importantly, the words on the ebony door plaque had changed. The words “ South Facing Inn” had disappeared, to be replaced by “Lotus View Pavilion”.
A bad feeling emerged in Ye Qingyu’s heart.
He slowly walked into the lobby.
“Yo, you’re here, my dear guest. Please come on in. Are you here for a refreshment or a room?” An assistant, wearing a dark-gray blouse, warmly ran out upon noticing Ye Qingyu, before greeting in a highly professional manner.
“I’m here for some food and won’t be staying,” Ye Qingyu replied.
This assistant looks unfamiliar, and is probably not a disciple of Ling Xiaoran and Heng Yuge.
“Alright, please follow me.” The assistant led the way in front.
As Ye Qingyu followed the assistant into the main hall, he swept a glance all around and saw that the arrangement had completely changed. The elements of the former South Facing Inn had completely disappeared. Even the calligraphic works which were personally done by Ling Xiaoran and were hung on the walls had been replaced by mountain landscape paintings.
Moreover, the shopkeeper standing at the counter and handling the accounts was no longer the young and beautiful Heng Yuge. Instead, it was a middle-aged man of forty to fifty years old. Although his inner yuan qi was not weak, his aura was apparently cultivated using the Greater One Sect’s technique. He wore a red jade cap and a black-colored silk shirt.
The singing father and daughter duo was also nowhere to be seen.
Their position on the stage had been taken by someone else – it was a storyteller who was wearing a grayish girdling scholar attire. He had scimitar-shaped brows, a wide forehead, a high nose, and bright eyes. His appearance was handsome and dignified, while his vigor was uncommon. His short black hair was bundled up using a green cloth, giving him a clean-cut and refined look.
He gave a short warm-up speech with great eloquence while adeptly playing bamboo clappers. His voice was sonorous while his yuan qi was plentiful. Upon speaking a handful of lines, he immediately received cheers from the entire restaurant.

Chapter 919:


Chapter 936 - An Old Acquaintance Dies in Flowing Light City (2)


There was a square table that was more than one meter long in front of the storyteller, and a cup of steaming-hot green tea was on the table.

There were around twenty to thirty people who gathered around. They were seated near their square red sandalwood tables and chatted idly while they enjoyed the tea.

The business in this restaurant was surprisingly good.

"Waiter, I want a pot of Nan Ge tea and two plates of pickled vegetables."

Ye Qingyu selected a seat near the window.

Nan Ge tea was created by Leng Xiaoran and named after his wife, Heng Yuge. The tea was blended with wild peach blossom petals and bamboo leaves, which made it refreshing, mellow, and very fragrant. It was one of the specialties of South Facing Inn.

"Hehe, I'm sorry sir. I can tell that you must be a regular customer here, but you haven't been back in some time, right? We don't sell Nan Ge tea these days. How about a pot of Biluochun [TN note: a type of green tea]? It is also fragrant with a refreshing taste and it is very moisturizing for your body." A strange expression flashed past the waiter's eyes but he carefully hid it. Then, he bowed slightly and smiled brightly.

"Oh." Ye Qingyu nodded and said nonchalantly, "It has indeed been a while. Oh yes, I remember that the original shopkeepers of this place were a young couple. Has there been a change of owners?"

The waiter smiled and said, "Yes, this business is now run by the Greater One Sect."

Just as he had expected.

Ye Qingyu nodded. He took out a half of a common origin crystal and placed it on the table, then turned to look out of the window.

The waiter did not say anything else and thanked him with a smile as he took the origin crystal. Then, he returned to the counter.

At that moment, the storyteller finished his opening preamble and took a long sip of hot tea before he started to tell his tale.

Smack!

The gavel smacked loudly on the table.

Silence fell upon the entire area even before he started to speak.

Everyone who had been speaking idly just moments before turned to look at the storyteller. Naturally, Ye Qingyu also turned in the direction of the sound.

"I said in my previous tale that the Greater One Sect's troops had descended on the city and that the leader of these rebels, Chen Zhengliang, sought after the position of the city lord. He then slandered the Greater One Sect, claiming that they were not fit to be called humans because they massacred their own and he refused to hand over the city. He insisted on protecting the survivors of the Immortal God Emperor Sect, and in a fit of anger, the Greater One Sect proclaimed war. War was about to break out any moment and those who supported the rebel leader, Chen Zhengliang, fiercely defended the city alongside him. They joined forces with the Immortal God Emperor Sect and planned to fight to their deaths. They put up a last-ditch resistance, but their capability, especially their ability to fight against the mighty Greater One Sect, meant that the days were especially dark and blood flowed like a river everywhere in the city…"

Ye Qingyu was completely astonished.

Chen Zhengliang had refused to hand over the city and even engaged in battle with the Greater One Sect Army?

This was a different version of events compared to what he had been expecting.

According to the storyteller, this happened because Chen Zhengliang insisted on protecting the survivors of the Immortal God Emperor Sect. Could it be because he was protecting Heng Yuge, Leng Xiaoran, and the others? Based on this story, the Greater One Sect Army's arrival seemed to be a surprise attack, which meant that no one from the Immortal God Emperor Sect had time to react before they were trapped within the city. Chen Zhengliang, Leng Xiaoran, and the others had gone through life and death together and once joined forces to resist the great army of the Demon Spider Race. It made sense that he would insist on protecting Leng Xiaoran and the others.

The feeling of dread grew stronger.

He listened calmly as the storyteller continued to tell his tale.

"This was how the bloody battle ended: After three intense days of fighting day and night… On the morning of the fourth day, the leaders of the Greater One Sect led the Greater One Sect Army, which had eight thousand strong men and one hundred warships, to sweep into and take control of the city and kill the leader of this rebellion… The elite soldiers of the Greater One Sect Army surged into the city in mighty numbers and crushed the rebellious traitors. Those who stood together with their leader, the so-called City Lord Chen Zhengliang, put up a desperate fight, but they were all killed. As for Leng Xiaoran and the others from the Immortal God Emperor Sect, they were also killed on the spot. There were also rebel factions that sided with the Immortal God Emperor Sect led by citizens like Golden Sword Scar, Elder Zheng, and others. They tried to flee in terror but they were captured by the Greater One Sect Army and were all brutally tortured. Ultimately, they were beheaded and their heads displayed on the city wall while their bodies were thrown onto the mountain of corpses that piled up at the city gates; their blood joined the sea of blood from the other deceased…"

The storyteller continued to describe the scene vividly and those around him cheered occasionally.

Ye Qingyu froze on the spot as though he had been struck by lightning.

Chen Zhengliang, Leng Xiaoran, Golden Sword Scar, Elder Zheng…

Are they all dead?

Ye Qingyu could not bring himself to accept this. He found it completely unbelievable.

The scenes from the past flashed past his mind like a slideshow.

These people were all brave warriors of the Human Race and heroic blood flowed through their veins. They had once fought alongside each other to resist the Demon Spider Army and fought desperately to protect Flowing Light City and the poor within the city. After they emerged victorious, they celebrated over drinks and shared their lofty ambitions for the future.

However, these people were now reduced to faceless names and they were called bandits and traitors who only existed in this storyteller's stories; their names sullied and dirtied by him for the pleasure and derision of his audience.

And their murderers were now hailed as heroes?

He was suddenly consumed by a rage so strong that it could ignite an entire field.

He gripped the teacup in his hand tightly and his eyes flashed icily but he did not do anything else. He did not let his emotions show on his face either.

Anyone who looked at him would assume that he was a listener who was so engrossed in the story that he could not help getting emotional.

Ye Qingyu was sure that this storyteller was just trying to make a living in the Greater One Sect's business establishment, so it made sense that he had changed the historical facts to favor the victors.

The true criminal who had slaughtered his good friends was none other than the Greater One Sect!

Ye Qingyu tamped down his urge to go on a killing rampage.

The storyteller continued to tell his tale.

"… The Immortal God Emperor Sect traitor, Heng Yuge, was captured alive and was left out in the blazing sun for ten days to force all the other forces and citizens who bore ill-will toward the Greater One Sect into submission. This female traitor was not remorseful at all and publicly insulted and swore at the Greater One Sect. Therefore, the leader of the Greater One Sect personally presided over her sentencing and she was sentenced to be beheaded publicly in the city. That evening when her sentence was due to be carried out, the glow from the setting sun was like blood that dyed the heavens red. Just before the knife was about to come down on her neck, a traitor who had planted himself in amongst the crowd suddenly appeared. This man had a bushy beard and he was extraordinarily powerful. His punches were like steel and their splendor as glorious as a sunset. The seven experts on stage were unable to subdue him and he almost managed to kill his way out of the execution ground. However, he was but one man, so how could he possibly defeat the entire Greater One Sect Army? The army soon surrounded him and just when he was about to be captured, he suddenly produced a mysterious treasure in the shape of a tile. He rescued that traitor Heng Yuge and they both disappeared in a bright flash, never to be seen again…"

Huh?

Heng Yuge was not dead but someone had come to her rescue?

His punches glowed like setting suns… and a bushy beard?

Ye Qingyu connected the dots and could not help heaving a sigh of relief when he heard that. His eyes flashed and he immediately guessed that the traitor who rescued Heng Yuge was most likely Hu Bugui. Hu Bugui was strong enough to have been able to escape alive while carrying off a rescue mission. Furthermore, he had half a piece of that mysterious tile, which was very formidable.

"… The rise of the Greater One Sect was unstoppable and rapid but this powerful force and its mighty power would not only stop there. The next chapter of my tale will be about the epic battle between the Human and Demon Races and how the Greater One Sect powerfully crushed the Demon Spider Race." The storyteller slowly picked up his teacup and took a sip of tea. The small bowl next to him was already filled with quite a number of coins.

After the storyteller finished his tale, the guests started to chatter amongst themselves as they sipped their tea.

"Shall we return tomorrow to hear the tale about the Demon Spider Race? I heard that this tale is even more exciting than that of Flowing Light City." Someone in the restaurant mentioned the battle in Flowing Light City that happened many years ago.

"I heard rumors that the Greater One Sect forced several demon races from the Clear River Domain back to their homeland and even the Demon Spider Race was forced to retreat back to their Heaven Spider Mountains. From the looks of things, I'd bet that we, the Human Race, will soon be ruling over the Clear River Domain. Haha, this is great news."

"Haha, that remains to be seen. Strictly speaking, rather than the Human Race ruling over the Clear River Domain, it would be the Greater One Sect that will rule over the Clear River Domain. The other Human Race sects have either been attacked or have been besieged, including the Immortal God Emperor Sect. A few days ago, I heard news that the Greater One Sect Army has already besieged the Immortal God Emperor Sect in the Wei Mountains and a battle might break out anytime soon. If this rumor is true, then the Immortal God Emperor Sect would be in a precarious position. Furthermore, the Greater One Sect's combat strength is not something that the Immortal God Emperor Sect would be able to go up against." A young man in black could not help interrupting.

Ye Qingyu was about to leave to rush to the mansion of the city lord of Flowing Light City and capture the men who held senior positions in the Greater One Sect that were stationed in the city, but he paused when he heard those words and decided to stay a while longer.

Then, a middle-aged man who gave off a vagrant air also joined the conversation. He sighed and said, "In the past two years, those sects who had formed alliances with the Immortal God Emperor Sect were all annihilated by the Greater One Sect, and I heard that the Hundred Spirits Sect is the only remaining sect. I don't know how long they'd be able to last either, but the strange thing is, the Greater One Sect doesn't seem to be making a move to attack this sect at the moment. The Hundred Spirits Sect might be safe for now."

"The Hundred Spirits Sect?"

Ye Qingyu's heart skipped a beat.

When he exchanged letters with Nan Tieyi two years ago, he had mentioned the Hundred Spirits Sect. After that battle, the Hundred Spirits Sect's gate was destroyed and it was almost completely annihilated, but the younger generation of disciples, including Shen Menghua and Liu Ruxin, worked to rebuild the sect. Although it was not yet back to its peak, it had gradually regained most of its power.

"That's where you are wrong. The Greater One Sect might not have launched an attack on the Hundred Spirits Sect, but that doesn't mean that the sect is safe from harm," suddenly, another person joined the conversation.

Ye Qingyu immediately recognized the newcomer as the storyteller who had left earlier but now returned to join the conversation.

Chapter 920:


Chapter 937 - The Evil That Befell the Hundred Spirits Sect


The storyteller returned to join the conversation and walked along the corridor at the back hall toward the guests who were engaged in a lively discussion. These people greeted him with a smile when they saw him, as though they were on familiar terms with one another. He sat down at the table and poured himself a cup of tea, then said slowly and mysteriously, "The Hundred Spirits Sect is also in extreme danger. Based on my reliable source, the Heaven Desire Demon Sect's army has passed by Flowing Light City an hour ago and is headed toward the Hundred Spirits Sect."

"The Heaven Desire Demon Sect?"

"Wasn't this notorious sect destroyed by the Immortal God Emperor Sect a year ago? How could they make a re-appearance? Have they come back from the dead?"

"Ah, I see…" someone exclaimed as realization dawned. "No wonder the Hundred Spirits Sect was the only sect that hadn't been attacked by the Greater One Sect—they must have reached an agreement with the Heaven Desire Demon Sect and left them to deal with the Hundred Spirits Sect. I remember back then, the Heaven Desire Demon Sect had once submitted to the Greater One Sect and they have been eyeing the Hundred Spirits Sect for some time. The female martial artists from the Hundred Spirits Sect would make the perfect vessels for those in the Heaven Desire Demon Sect to cultivate their demonic arts on."

Immediately, some people in the group understood the implications of his statement.

Soon afterward, everyone let out a sigh.

"If those female disciples from the Hundred Spirits Sect are captured, they will probably be tortured to death…"

"I remember when the Heaven Desire Demon Sect attacked the Buddhist sect, the Well-Awakened Sect, back in those days. They were extremely violent and the corpses of more than a hundred nuns piled up like a mountain. Their bodies were stripped naked and they were covered in bruises and injuries. They all died extremely tragically…"

"Any woman who is unfortunate enough to be captured by the Heaven Desire Demon Sect would suffer a fate worse than death. The Hundred Spirits Sect is really in a perilous situation this time."

"That might not necessarily be true. They might still have a fighting chance. I heard that the young master of the Immortal God Emperor Sect, Nan Tieyi, is currently at the Hundred Spirits Sect, so they might send their disciples to extend aid. They are allies after all."

Ye Qingyu left immediately when he heard that.

He disappeared into the Void with a flash, as though he had melted into it, so no one noticed his disappearance.

Dozens of breaths later, the urgent footsteps of heavily armored soldiers could be heard.

The waiter led dozens of Greater One Sect's experts clad in their red armor into the great hall. They stormed in aggressively, catching those who were chattering inside by surprise. These people immediately shut their mouths and looked downward, afraid that they would be accused of causing trouble. The leader of the soldiers exuded an incredibly strong aura. His gaze swept the entire hall before he stared at the waiter and asked, "Where is he?"

The waiter was surprised and pointed to where Ye Qingyu had been seated, then exclaimed in surprise, "That man was seated over there and asked for Nan Ge tea the moment he arrived. He even mentioned the traitorous couple from the Immortal God Emperor Sect… Strange, how did he suddenly go missing? I didn't see him leave at all… How odd!"

Hundred Flowers Valley, where the Hundred Spirits Sect was located—

This picturesque and beautiful place with a natural charm was now in danger.

Black inky clouds rolled over the dark sky as though a hurricane was sweeping past. The sky was eerily dark, without a trace of light. This was accompanied by wailing sounds that sounded like vengeful souls.

A dense evil aura permeated the heavens and earth.

In only a few hours, the devastating battle had turned the area within a thousand kilometers radius into utter shambles. The flora and fauna were burnt to a crisp, the mountains had collapsed, the sky had shattered, and the rivers had dried up. Countless spiritual flora and fauna were smashed into powder and countless mythical creatures were turned into mottled flesh and blood.

The picturesque scenery of Hundred Flowers Valley, where hundreds of flowers had once bloomed so beautifully that it resembled a fairyland, was now completely destroyed.

The faint floral fragrance that had wafted through the air was now replaced by the pungent and nauseating scent of blood.

This scene looked like a scene from hell or the end of days.

The Heaven Desire Demon Sect's sudden arrival had plunged the Hundred Spirits Sect into a hopeless situation.

They had been prepared for this attack, but the Heaven Desire Demon Sect's terrifying power was beyond the limits of what the Hundred Spirits Sect could handle. It had only been a few hours, but now, twelve layers of the defensive mountain formation that the Hundred Spirits Sect operated for thousands of years had been destroyed.

Since the sect was founded thousands of years ago, the Hundred Spirits Sect's defensive mountain formation was reinforced and enhanced throughout the generations. It was made up of thirty layers and these layers were shaped like giant petals that wrapped themselves in layers facing inward. It drew on the spiritual pulse of the earth to activate the power of the world within the surrounding hundreds of kilometers, and it contained an ancient and mysterious power that protected the entire Hundred Flowers Valley within it. This formation had withstood the test of multiple battles and helped the Hundred Spirits Sect to overcome various crises.

However, the twelve outer protective layers of this formation had been completely destroyed by the Heaven Desire Demon Sect, and the remaining eighteen formations trembled feebly like a torn cloth fluttering in the wind, forming layers of irregular and invisible ripples as it put up a final desperate struggle.

Across the entire area, experts from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect appeared one after another.

These black figures exuded demon qi and appeared from the Void like a multitude of ants coming out of the woodwork, releasing a boundless black evil mist that had an evil corrosive ability as though it had the power to swallow the world. Rays of mighty brutal qi tunneled madly through the air and brought with them a nefarious qi that swept through the surroundings. It seemed like these qis would not stop moving until the formations were completely destroyed.

On the ground—

Large numbers of corpses lay in a huge pool of blood, the vast majority of which were female disciples dressed in the robes of the Hundred Spirits Sect.

Their tattered robes were drenched in bright-red blood. These were young girls who were in the prime of their lives and who were at their most beautiful. It was a pity that their deaths were so tragic. Their bare skin was as beautiful as white jade but their skin had lost its healthy luster. Instead, their skin was covered by injuries so deep that their bones were visible and their flesh and skin were all strangely shriveled.

These fresh flowers had all withered and died here.

There were more than ten female corpses near the twentieth layer of the formation. These women looked older and their yuan qi was comparatively stronger, which meant that they were probably the elite core of the Hundred Spirits Sect. However, these corpses were now icy cold and their bodies were badly mutilated with their innards and intestines spilling out of their bodies, as though they had been violently ripped out of their bodies then abandoned on the ground. It was an extremely gruesome sight to behold.

In the sky—

Countless experts from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect gathered around the defensive formation and were frantically releasing corrosive demon qi that swallowed and grated against the last of the defensive formation.

Hundreds of figures could be seen standing within an inky black ball of light. These people looked to be about in their twenties or thirties. The men were tall and burly with imposing auras, while the women were as beautiful as flowers, smiled sweetly, and were clad in soft silk.

They were the upper echelon and the core figures of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect.

They whispered and shared jokes amongst themselves, as though they were tourists who were passing by this piece of hell. They acted like the horrific scenes of this place had nothing to do with them.

However, upon taking a closer look, it was clear that they were each controlling wisps of black mist, and this mist seemed to be made up of a multitude of vengeful souls. This mist was full of violent and murderous intent; it was both eerie and mysterious.

In the air, the evil demon qi howled madly and then it transformed into something else. The countless rays of black vengeful-soul mist let out piercing howls and wails, then swiftly gathered toward a specific direction to transform into a gigantic black skull. This skull plummeted down from the sky and smashed hard against the remaining ten layers of the defensive mountain formation.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The sounds of the collision echoed for thousands of kilometers, as though a heavenly thunder had rolled across the sky, and tremors shook the entire Hundred Flowers Valley.

The dazzling splendor from the remaining layers of the defensive formation became dimmer and weaker, as though they were as fragile and thin as glass. The mysterious ghostly mist and cruel qi violently continued to erode the formation, and this formation looked as though it would shatter into countless shards at any moment. It was clearly on the verge of collapsing.

Then, the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect made an appearance.

He was an extremely beautiful man.

He looked like a banished immortal and he exuded an ethereal vibe. At first glance, he could be mistaken for an Immortal. He stood with his hands behind his back and a Blood Lotus Jade hung from his forehead. His eyes slanted upward and they were filled with confidence and contempt. There was a column of light that was dozens of meters tall and it was also as black as ink. It gave off an air of extreme violence, evil, and madness that entirely shattered his Immortal image.

There were six people from the Human Race nearby and their auras surged as they exchanged blows with the experts of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect.

These seven people played a huge part in resisting the Heaven Desire Demon Sect's attack.

Otherwise, the Hundred Spirits Sect's defensive mountain formation would have already been completely eroded by the evil demon qi released by those experts.

Despite the combined strength of those seven people, they were still unable to truly turn the tide. They were completely overpowered and surrounded by the enemy and seemed like a small boat fighting against a storm, about to be swallowed up by the huge waves at any moment.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

They battled on fiercely and intensely, constantly killing countless experts from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect. These dead disciples turned into a bloody mist that fell from the sky, but they would be replaced by an even greater number of experts. There was just too many of them.

"Cackle, cackle,  cackle… Do you really believe that you could be their saviors? You guys are merely rotten shrimps to us. You have clearly bitten off more than you can chew." The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect laughed heartily as he looked disdainfully at the seven of them. His face was filled with unbridled arrogance and two rays of blood-colored splendor shot out from his eyes. He waved his long and slender fingers, which moved as fluidly as the ripples on a river.

"Kill—!"

Suddenly, as his fingers moved, a piercing wail burst forth from the inky black light column behind him.

Rays of black piercing mist and fog surged like raging demons as though they carried the intense pain, despair, rage, curses, and hatred of countless living beings before they died. They were violent and savage and would cause chills to run down everyone's spine. They tunneled through the Void like a tornado and instantly shot toward the figure opposite him.

"Humph, you effeminate fool, stop spouting nonsense. Long before you even had teeth, I was already making waves all over the Clear River Domain! Why don't you take a good look at how many evil deeds you have committed? Do you really think that no one would dare to stand up against you? Since you have the good fortune of meeting me today, this will be the day you die!" A burly man bellowed angrily and punched out, smashing the dozens of Heaven Desire Demon Sect disciples in front of him into smithereens.

This was the chief bandit of the Clear River Domain, Hu Bugui.
