Chapter 757:


Chapter 775 - Murderous Spirit of Heaven and Earth


The [Red Lotus Hellfire] raged, burning everything in its way.

The [Cloud Top Cauldron] remained suspended in the Void like a divine link and released strands of bright-yellow silk ribbons. These ribbons dangled from the cauldron, protecting the entire mountain from the relentless attacks of the raging [Red Lotus Hellfire]. No matter how it raged, it was unable to break past the silk ribbon barrier.

Thirty minutes later.

"Crack!"

A faint cracking sound came from the giant red egg at the bottom of the parasol tree.

"Crack!"

The sound of an eggshell cracking open resounded again.

Under the parasol tree.

The giant red egg shook slightly.

The cracking noises increased in frequency as the giant red egg shook even harder and more intensely than before. Suddenly, there was a loud cracking sound, as though something had broken, and a crack that was an arm's length appeared on the shell of the giant egg, which was made out of flesh and blood.

Suddenly—

"Crack!"

The giant red egg broke apart.

A smooth, dainty white hand, which looked like it was carved from exquisite jade, emerged from the eggshell.

Next, an arm emerged.

Delicate and fair, slender but powerful.

Then, there was a loud bang as the eggshell exploded.

A handsome figure emerged from the egg.

His face was like beautiful jade, warm and handsome. His features were like an exquisite carving, sculpted and angular. He had a pair of dashing eyebrows, his eyes were like stars, dark and deep, and the bridge of his nose was high and straight.

His long, waist-length hair was tied loosely behind his head and it danced gently in the wind.

The glow from the yellow mist was imprinted on his long white robe.

Ye Qingyu gave off a dazzling flow and an ethereal, elegant aura, as though he was an Immortal who had descended from the Ninth Heaven. Those who saw him could not help wanting to bow at his feet.

His original face and body had been restored.

Not a trace of the injuries he had sustained remained. He was now completely healed, his sculpted muscles were like jade crystals and gave off a mysterious glow. His muscles were not bursting out of his skin, but looked both powerful and beautiful, as though his entire being had been carved from jade. His skin was flushed with a healthy red glow, surging with blood qi that was full of vitality.

As the sun shone down on him, Ye Qingyu's skin, flesh, bones, and even his tendons were full of the purest form of power and gave off a healthy, smooth glow.

"Phew..."

Ye Qingyu exhaled loudly.

When he had been inside the giant egg undergoing nirvana, he had remained conscious throughout the process, so he had an idea of what had changed within him. He could not hold back his happiness from spreading across his face.

He lifted his hand and a brand new power slowly appeared.

This flame resembled a candle flame, flickering in the air, as though it could be put out by a passing breeze. However, on his fingers, it was full of spiritual energy. It bore an uncanny resemblance to the chaotic mist silk ribbons that dangled from the [Cloud Top Cauldron], but its aura was much purer.

"This is such a mysterious power. I sense a shred of Immortal will... Could this be the power of Immortals?"

He pointed his middle finger.

That yellow mist encircled his finger like a flame, transmitting an affectionate consciousness, as though it was a child who had developed a strong attachment to Ye Qingyu.

"Never would I have thought that these three powers would merge together under the influence of the rainbow power from the Phoenix blood. Now that such a transformation has occurred... this is very interesting. This is truly a blessing in disguise. I never expected to be able to undergo nirvana, which must have happened because of that drop of Phoenix blood that was given to me by the Celestial Phoenix Maiden. Yes, and this parasol tree must have played a part too..."

Ye Qingyu quickly surmised what must have happened.

This power, which resembled Immortal power, that encircled his finger was no longer a sole yuan qi, and it was no longer the power of lightning, wind, or ice flame, but was now a brand new, pure power that contained the primeval power of the Magical Great Dao.

"I'll just call it 'Immortal power' for now. Haha. I can't believe that I managed to cultivate Immortal qi." Ye Qingyu was slightly proud of himself.

The yuan qi that had been repressed within him was now totally restored—not just that, it was now many times denser than before. After undergoing nirvana, he had not just managed to cultivate a trace of Immortal qi, but Ye Qingyu felt like he had been born again. His powerful physical cultivation had also increased many times over and was now unbelievably powerful.

As he stood under the parasol tree, Ye Qingyu felt like his bones, blood, and cells were all filled with an incredibly powerful energy.

He used his divine consciousness to peer within his body.

He discovered that there was a brand new vitality that continually roamed around his entire body. As for the boundless waves in his dantian world, they had become purer and smoother, the waves crashing up to the heavens. He even noticed that he felt more relaxed than before with every breath he took.

It was just as though the power within him had peeled back all the layers and transmitted the purest aura of the heavens into his heart and dantian.

Rebirth after nirvana.

That was the marvelous thing about nirvana.

It's no wonder that, according to legend, a Phoenix would undergo nine transformations after nirvana and could even surpass fiendgods to be one of the most terrifying beings in the universe. Even during the ancient Fiendgod Age, the Phoenix Race was not one to be trifled with.

Then, Ye Qingyu looked up at the top of the parasol tree.

"Why... why is the Celestial Phoenix Maiden still an egg?"

Ye Qingyu was astonished.

That giant rainbow egg was still securely nestled in the Phoenix nest. This meant that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden had not been reborn after nirvana.

He looked around again.

Outside the protective yellow mist barrier from the [Cloud Top Cauldron], the hellfire still raged violently and continued to attack the thin light curtain. He unleashed his divine sense and did not detect any trace of the auras of the Four Stars holy girl and the others in the Void.

"A long time must have passed since the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and myself have undergone nirvana," he mused to himself.

It had definitely been more than four hours since the Celestial Phoenix Maiden underwent nirvana. Could something have happened?

He turned to stare in concern at the giant rainbow egg.

At that moment.

Something strange happened.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

The power of laws in the sky started to descend into chaos, as though someone had flung a large rock into a calm river, causing ripples to spread rapidly.

Once the laws of the universe changed, the surrounding area could also change without warning.

The beautiful scenery suddenly turned gloomy as thunder and lightning rumbled across the clear sky, turning it dark, as if a thick layer of clouds had blanketed the heavens.

The sky darkened.

An unknown aura began to spread across the area.

The earth rumbled and the mountains shook.

The primeval power that had gathered in midair shattered into tiny pieces and rained down on the ground. A wild, chaotic, murderous spirit spread across the primeval Heaven and earth, instantly filling the entire space.

"What is happening?"

Ye Qingyu was shocked.

The calm Heaven and earth were suddenly brimming with murderous spirit.

"If the sky releases murderous spirit, the stars' positions will change. If the earth releases murderous spirit, all sorts of divine creatures will appear..." Ye Qingyu squinted. Up in the sky, the stars seemed to flicker brightly. On the ground, the earth kept shattering as though serpentine monsters were rolling under it. According to ancient texts, these were the signs of the murderous spirit of Heaven and earth.

This murderous spirit of Heaven and earth had the power to kill gods and demons alike.

This was a sign of a great disaster!

Ye Qingyu instantly realized that time was almost up and the Door of Life was about to shut!

Once the Door of Life slammed shut, there would be great changes to the 18th district.

Once the Door of Life closed, this district would become a death trap that could kill even a Quasi-emperor.

Time was of the essence.

"Damn it... What do I do... The Phoenix egg is still showing no signs of hatching... If we continue to waste time here, we will all be trapped." Ye Qingyu suddenly grew anxious when he realized this.

He stared at that giant egg above the tree. It still showed no signs of moving.

Should he take the egg with him?

He thought quickly as he examined that giant egg.

"This won't work..."

He immediately dismissed that idea.

If he removed the Phoenix egg from the parasol tree, it would be highly likely that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's nirvana transformation would fail.

He looked at the sky and the earth again and closely observed the rate of change before he started estimating how much time he had left.

"If I'm not wrong, we only have under four hours left before the Door of Life shuts..."

The problem was, it was at least several hundred thousand kilometers from here to the Door of Life's exit. After they left this small tombstone universe, they would have to pass through the sea of hurricane lilies and walk past the sea of tombstones and the ancient fiendgod city to reach the exit. This would take at least two hours or more.

He really did not have much time left.

What should he do?

Should he abandon the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and leave?

Ye Qingyu shook his head.

The Celestial Phoenix Maiden had taken care of him on the journey here and he owed his nirvana transformation to her as well. He owed her this. He could not make such a choice.

Thus... he could only wait.

He could only hope that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden would awaken at the crucial moment.

Ye Qingyu paced back and forth under the parasol tree.

Time ticked by—second by second, minute by minute.

There was still no movement from the giant golden egg.

Every second that passed felt like a year to Ye Qingyu, and he only grew more anxious. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do but continue to wait under the tree.

He did not even know how much time had passed.

Ye Qingyu was in such a state of anxiety that his face was covered in cold sweat.

At that moment, his ears suddenly moved.

He could hear the muffled sound of something cracking at the top of the parasol tree.

An expression of delight flashed across Ye Qingyu's face.

Tiny cracks, each as thin as a strand of hair, had appeared on the rainbow-colored eggshell.

"Crack!"

He heard it again, the sound of an eggshell cracking open.

"Boom!"

A figure shot up toward the sky.

The Celestial Phoenix Maiden transformed into flowing light and broke out of her shell.

Eggshell pieces flew everywhere.

She took a large gulp of air and summoned all the broken pieces of her eggshell into her mouth before she slowly descended onto the ground beneath the parasol tree.

She was still clad in her purple armor, which from behind made her look elegant and noble, just like a lotus that had bloomed in clear water. The rainbow floating light and the magical glow only served to enhance each other's beauty as they encircled her figure, as though they dressed her in a rainbow fairy dress.

Chapter 758:


Chapter 776 - Fatty, Why Are You Not Leaving?
"Goodness, at long last, you have finally hatched..." Ye Qingyu looked at the purple figure in the Phoenix nest with elation, then he became slightly dazed.
He could not detect any energy waves from the Celestial Phoenix Maiden at all. She was just like an ordinary human, a completely blank slate that closely resembled the primeval aura, and she gave off a faint orchid fragrance.
It was as though she had returned to her original state.
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden's aura had returned to simplicity, just like an ordinary mortal. However, Ye Qingyu knew that she had definitely become many times more powerful than before, and had become even more terrifying. This was his gut feeling as an expert, and he could not be wrong.
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden had become even more ethereal, more otherworldly and elegant than before.
At the top of the parasol tree.
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden was surrounded by rainbow mist, which obscured her features. She put on her mask again and jumped down from the tree, coming to join him under the parasol tree.
"Let's go!"
She glanced at Ye Qingyu, then flew off and headed for the foot of the mountain without saying anything else.
Ye Qingyu immediately understood that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden must have already sensed or known about the murderous intent that filled Heaven and earth and knew the predicament they were in. There was no need for any further explanation.
They had to escape before the Door of Life slammed shut.
If they continued wasting time here, once the 18th district had completely transformed into a dangerous death zone, even a Quasi-emperor at the peak of the martial way could be instantly killed, let alone people like them.
Ye Qingyu trailed behind the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and followed her to the foot of the mountain.
He did not notice that a strange look had flashed through the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's eyes when she caught sight of his true features. It could have been surprise, amazement, or even a bit of relief.
It was just an instant before that look disappeared.
After all, she was a cold and clever female Heaven's prideling. She did not probe further into Ye Qingyu's change in looks and aura—in fact, she still had some awareness even as she underwent nirvana, so she had an idea of what had transpired during that time.
Ye Qingyu was in a hurry to leave, so he did not notice these details nor did he provide any explanations.
Their top priority was to escape this place alive.
They stood at the foot of the mountain.
All around them, the [Red Lotus Hellfire] raged wildly like ferocious creatures.
"We'll need to come up with a plan to break past the [Red Lotus Hellfire]. You should proceed with caution, the flames are terrifying..." Ye Qingyu said, warning the Celestial Phoenix Maiden to be careful, just in case she did not know how scary these flames could be.
However...
Her expression turned grave.
Under her mask, her red lips parted slightly as she faced the [Red Lotus Hellfire] and sucked in a huge mouthful.
The unbelievable happened.
Ye Qingyu watched dumbstruck as the raging hellfire turned into tiny wisps, as though a mysterious power had drawn them in, each as big as a clear spring, before they were sucked into the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's belly.
"Uh..."
Ye Qingyu stared at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden in astonishment.
He thought he must have been seeing things.
This woman's power was just too heaven-defying.
These flames were said to be able to burn all things, and yet this woman had eaten them up as if they were cotton candy. Was she not afraid that she would have diarrhea after this?
Three breaths passed.
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden had sucked in more than half of the hellfire in the surrounding tens of kilometers.
Ye Qingyu had started to catch a few clues.
Now that the Four Stars holy girl was not around to control it, the [Red Lotus Hellfire] had lost its intense murderous spirit and spiritual qi consciousness. Although it was still scary, it was now like a creature without volition and it stopped consciously resisting. It was thus a lot easier to handle now.
"Hey... wait... wait... wait..." Ye Qingyu's eyes lit up as he suddenly thought of something and rushed to stop her.
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden stopped and turned to look at him, only to see Ye Qingyu waving at her.
The [Cloud Top Cauldron], which was slowly turning in the Void, then buzzed and vibrated. It recalled the yellow silk ribbons that dangled from it, then shrank into the size of a fist and appeared on his palm.
"Hehe... Since this [Red Lotus Hellfire] is so powerful... let me have half... Hehe..." His lips curved into a smile and he ignored the look of disdain that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden shot him. He muttered some ancient characters and the [Cloud Top Cauldron] started to turn once again.
The next moment.
Whatever remained of the ordinary [Red Lotus Hellfire] swarmed crazily toward it and transformed into a gigantic blood-colored funnel before it was absorbed by the [Cloud Top Cauldron].
Just as he expected, now that the Four Stars holy girl was not around to control it, the [Red Lotus Hellfire] had become like a poisonous serpent in hibernation. It had lost its attacking edge and was thus easily absorbed into his bronze cauldron.
The Four Stars holy girl had left the [Red Lotus Hellfire] behind to kill both of them. Never would she have thought that she had left them with a precious gift instead.
"Let's go!"
The Celestial Phoenix Maiden transformed into flowing light and hurried toward where they had come from.
Ye Qingyu activated a pair of yuan qi wings and followed closely behind her.
They traced their way back at maximum speed, covering a distance of ten kilometers  with every step.
A while later.
As they flew past the grassy plains they had passed by earlier, Ye Qingyu looked over and was alarmed when he saw Black Demon qi surging all across the land. The demonic waves billowed and black clouds rolled, instantly blanketing half the land. The area that had been conquered by the demonic qi started to give off a terrifying aura.
This was probably what an apocalyptic murderous spirit would look like.
They moved at the speed of light, breezing through the Void and cutting the cloud layers open like a sharp sword. They moved as though they were about to tear the heavens open, the loud roaring noise overriding the surrounding rolls of thunder.
They were running for their lives and did not have the time to care about anything else.
As they passed by the grassy plains once again, Ye Qingyu looked down and discovered an extremely odd phenomenon.
"That is..."
His pupils shrank.
The grassy plains were once lush and green, but suddenly, blocks of things that looked like black bamboo started to emerge from the ground.
"These... are... tombstones!"
Upon closer inspection, Ye Qingyu immediately recognized this "black bamboo" that dotted the landscape. These were the black, wordless tombstones from the sea of tombstones. However, these black tombstones were not fully erected and were still half-buried in the ground. They looked like plants that had been reawakened and were slowly growing at their own pace, not reaching full maturity yet.
"How could this be? Why would tombstones appear here?" Ye Qingyu was shocked and he suddenly had a bad feeling about this.
They had to leave this place as soon as possible.
They frantically sped up and traveled at their maximum speed.
Ye Qingyu would look down periodically.
He discovered that the tombstones they had come across at the start at the mountain had only just revealed their arches. The tombstones grew taller the further they traveled. As they approached the mountain from where they had entered this universe, the tombstones on the ground were almost half-grown, revealing their original form.
Ye Qingyu could also sense that the aura of the ancient city of the fiendgod was exactly the same as the silent black tombstones in the sea of tombstones. All the tombstones that had grown from the pretty landscape below were giving off a chilly murderous spirit.
As they drew closer, he could sense an extremely scary power bursting forth from within, as though it was about to be swallowed by this murderous spirit.
Beside him, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden had also noticed the changes on the ground.
She did not reveal anything but as she used all her might to move even faster, rainbow-colored lights burst forth from her. They both sprinted across the Void at increasingly faster speeds—an average expert at the Immortal Step realm would probably not be able to see them with his naked eye.
Fifteen minutes later.
The exit area of the gigantic tombstone universe was already quickly approaching.
A terrifyingly powerful murderous spirit that was completely unlike the black tombstones surged beneath them.
Ye Qingyu looked down and saw a large grey-bronze divine temple below.
He remembered this grey-bronze divine temple because the Celestial Phoenix Maiden had warned him not to approach it when they had first passed by. There had been a giant palm print and a sword slash on it, which had left a deep impression on him.
Ye Qingyu gave the divine temple a second glance subconsciously. He then discovered other strange things.
"Hmm... That is..."
He caught sight of a chubby figure next to the divine temple. That chubby, blue, bald man had attracted his attention.
"Haha... It's Sheng Yan! I can't believe he is still alive."
Ye Qingyu recognized this person as the weird fatty that had entered the Door of Life together with him initially, but later, he did not know what had become of this person.
This was truly a pleasant surprise.
Although they were not close friends, Ye Qingyu had a pretty good impression of this fatty. He had been worried about this fatty earlier. After all, the appearance of the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and the others had become a major variable. Ye Qingyu had assumed that this bald fatty would not be able to survive past the murderous spirit of the 18th district or the guerilla attacks of the other experts, but unexpectedly, this fatty must have had nine lives, for he was still running around.
Ye Qingyu was secretly slightly pleased.
He slowed down, approached the divine temple, and inspected it closely.
He spotted that scaredy-cat fatty, Sheng Yan, running circles around the divine temple surreptitiously. He could not figure out what he was trying to do, but Sheng Yan looked very odd—his expression was grim but his eyes flashed with urgency.
He had a tattered licorice gourd in his hand and this gourd gave off the aura of a mysterious power that protected him within. This was how this fatty could run freely around the divine temple, which was filled with terrifying murderous spirit. Otherwise, he would have become a pool of blood.
"Stupid fatty! Time is running out, if we don't leave now, we'll lose our chance... Why are you not leaving?" Ye Qingyu paused in the Void and shouted out a warning.
Beside the divine temple.
Sheng Yan continued to rush forward, only pausing for a moment at Ye Qingyu's warning. He clearly recognized Ye Qingyu's voice but he did not look back. He carried the bottle gourd in his hands and walked around the grey-bronze divine temple. Nonetheless, he waved toward the exit, motioning for Ye Qingyu to ignore him and leave.

Chapter 759:


Chapter 777 - Emergence of the Quasi-emperor


"Hmm? What does that mean?"

Ye Qingyu was puzzled.

At the Taowu Mountain Range, this fatty had acted as though he had been so fearful of dying. The attraction force of the dark Door of Life had been enough to give him the shivers, so why did he still loiter around in such a dangerous place that was filled with murderous spirit now?

Was he trying to die a heroic death here?

Or could there be a peerless precious treasure within the divine temple that he was not willing to give up?

Ye Qingyu was baffled.

"He is a descendant of the [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]," the Celestial Phoenix Maiden informed him when she turned to see what had caused Ye Qingyu to stop.

"Eh? [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]?" Ye Qingyu was unable to wrap his head around it for a while. When it finally sank in, his jaw dropped and he yelped in surprise, "What? A descendent... of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]? Are you saying, this fatty is..."

He was extremely stunned.

After his initial astonishment had faded, Ye Qingyu suddenly thought of something as his gaze fell on the tattered licorice gourd that Sheng Yan was holding. He could not help recalling a few things.

According to legend, the highly talented and extremely handsome [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had successfully entered the Door of Darkness but never found his way out. Approximately a century later, his descendants used a blood sacrifice occult technique to summon a tattered licorice gourd from the Door of Darkness.

A drop of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei’s] blood was contained within the gourd.

Thereafter, less than one thousand years later, rumors swirled that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei’s] descendants had lost the gourd that contained his blood. The legend of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] stopped circulating once the gourd had been lost. Every few thousand years, the later generations of the Human Race would wail in despair.

Ye Qingyu looked contemplatively at that chubby figure who kept circling the divine temple.

The legend must not have actually been true. Maybe the licorice gourd had never been lost but had always been in the hands of his descendants. They might have circulated rumors about the gourd being lost in order to protect the gourd and prevent it from being stolen by other races.

If this fatty was truly a descendant of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], then it made sense that he was trying his best to enter the Door of Life and was willing to risk it all to come to this 18th district—he had to be searching for [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].

All these years, [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei's] descendants had never believed that their ancestor had perished and had always been trying to search for him. Hmm, could a descendant of
[Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]
have mastered the meaning behind the emperor blood, or discovered some kind of secret?

After making his way here, could this fatty be in search of the benevolence left behind by his ancestor, Li Xiaofei?

Nevermind, he would draw his own conclusions after further investigation.

In the Void, Ye Qingyu hesitated for a moment, then headed straight for the divine temple.

The Celestial Phoenix Maiden did not hesitate at all as she followed closely behind Ye Qingyu toward the direction of the divine temple.

Soon afterward, they both landed.

Next to the divine temple.

"Fatty, are you... truly [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei's] descendant?" This was the first time Ye Qingyu was in such close proximity to the divine temple, and he instantly sensed a chilly murderous spirit and a mysterious force which was tearing at his entire body, as though he would be annihilated by it any moment.

Ye Qingyu had regained his original looks, but the fatty clearly recognized him from his voice and aura. Surprise flashed through his eyes when he registered Ye Qingyu's true features and aura.

However, he ignored Ye Qingyu's question and only spared him a glance. Then, he started to walk rapidly around the divine temple, his mouth constantly moving as he hastily chanted a mysterious battle song that had a bizarre rhythm and flow.

This battle song had a simple and monotonous rhythm and was not from any modern language. It sounded odd to the ears but contained an ancient aura, as though fiendgods were singing languidly. The notes swept across the Void, barely discernible, just like they did not belong to this era.

As he sang the battle song, the tattered licorice gourd slowly started to give off an invisible but mysterious aura. There was a trace of powerful magical ability contained within this aura that managed to keep the chaotic murderous spirit that surrounded this place at bay.

"Time is running out, fatty. There will be time enough in the future, so stop wasting your time here. The universe has undergone tremendous change, the death zone has been activated, and the Door of Life is about to shut soon. Leave with us as soon as possible!" Ye Qingyu urged him as he tracked the changes in the surrounding area.

Sheng Yan continued to ignore him.

That bald fatty's attention was solely focused on chanting that battle song. The ripples in the melody entered the licorice gourd and activated the feeble, barely discernible blood-colored mist within it.

As he circled the divine temple over and over again, the blood-colored mist continued to sweep past each zone of the divine temple. The fatty's gaze followed the blood-colored mist and he would often search the area with his gaze, as though he was looking for something.

Ye Qingyu was about to urge him once more.

Suddenly, a powerful aura swept out of the divine temple, as though it had lived through hundreds and thousands of years of life, and an ancient voice then resounded.

"Xiao Yan, please leave. I have already imparted my legacy to you, please leave as soon as possible..."

This voice was ancient, feeble, and mysterious, but it contained an authority that caused one's mind to waver as though it was from an Immortal deity. The voice contained an authority that could not be emulated by a Saint.

The bronze wall behind the divine temple.

Ye Qingyu was completely dumbstruck.

Lightning flashed across his mind.

This was...

Could it be...

He did not dare to imagine.

Beside him, astonishment filled the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's eyes, in sharp contrast to her usual cold and expressionless self.

Nearby, Sheng Yan's face was filled with shock, then despair, "No, ancestor. I will not leave, I won't... I will rescue you..."

Sheng Yan's face was streaked with tears.

He walked even faster and chanted even louder, as though he was burning the foundation of his life. He continued to scan the outer walls of the divine temple, and the blood-colored splendor from the gourd became more and more obvious.

Ye Qingyu and the Celestial Phoenix Maiden were both still in an extreme state of shock.

They instantly deduced the true identity of this voice.

The legendary [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had not perished in the 18th district.

He was still alive.

He was trapped within the divine temple!

Sheng Yan's expressions and words were proof enough.

This piece of information was just too astonishing.

The Quasi-emperor Li Xiaofei of the Human Race, the Heaven's prideling of four thousand years ago, was still alive!

Ye Qingyu was delighted.

This was a Quasi-emperor of the Human Race, the Heaven's prideling who had been almost invincible in the past. If he was still alive, it would be great news to the Human Race, who were on the verge of extinction.

His gaze fell upon the divine temple.

He wondered what kind of place this divine temple was—to have the power to trap a Quasi-emperor expert.

Ye Qingyu gave this divine temple a second assessing glance.

Other than the powerful murderous spirit that enveloped this ancient and worn divine temple, there was no trace of a formation. As for this murderous spirit, with the exception of the area surrounding the bronze walls where it was coming from a sculpture carved in the likeness of a monster, most of it seemed to be coming from within the divine temple.

Ye Qingyu sensed that this divine temple was like a container that was about to explode, and within it was the purest form of apocalyptic murderous spirit that originated from the Fiendgod Age.

Since this divine temple had the power to entrap the
[Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]
, then why was this fatty constantly circling this place?

Ye Qingyu looked at Sheng Yan in confusion.

"He is using a secret technique and has activated the gourd to search for the weakness in this divine temple," the Celestial Phoenix Maiden said.

He was using the blood of the Quasi-emperor to lead the way.

The blood of those almighty experts of the Magical Great Dao contained some kind of spiritual energy. Within a certain area, their blood would automatically find their way back to their master's body.

Once that drop of blood contained within the gourd was extremely close to [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], it would be able to penetrate through the tiniest crack to find its way back into his body.

If there was a crack, it meant that there was a weakness.

The Celestial Phoenix Maiden had noticed that Sheng Yan was using a mysterious battle song to activate his blood. He was using his blood to support that drop of Quasi-emperor blood in order to search for a weakness in the divine temple and rescue [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].

Suddenly—

"I've found it!"

Sheng Yan, who was standing on the left side of the divine temple, suddenly exclaimed in delight.

Ye Qingyu and the Celestial Phoenix Maiden looked at each other in shock, then hurried over.

Sheng Yan's tattered licorice gourd suddenly increased in blood-colored splendor. Within this splendor was a red laser beam, which was formed by mist. It shot out swiftly and headed straight for a certain spot in the divine temple.

"That is..."

Ye Qingyu followed the trajectory of this laser beam.

There was a sword mark left on the bronze wall with a scary aura that wound upward, almost to the top of this bronze wall. Ye Qingyu had noticed this sword mark as well as the gigantic palm print less than one hundred meters away the last time he was here.

The blood-colored splendor headed straight for the middle part of the sword mark, the point where the deepest indentation on the wall was.

This was the weakness that Sheng Yan had been searching for, the weakest point of the bronze wall that surrounded the divine temple.

Ye Qingyu looked at the sword mark that wound upward, and a look of disappointment flashed through his eyes. If they wanted to send that drop of blood through, the only way was through the corresponding point of the red laser beam. However, with his current vision, he could not see a crack at all in this indentation.

Sheng Yan suddenly roared and unleashed a powerful and ancient force. Light blue mist surged forth from his body and a powerful aura spread across the surroundings.

This fatty... was so powerful?

He had only been pretending to be weak earlier.

Ye Qingyu was slightly surprised.

Ye Qingyu had suspected that this bald and chubby man had been hiding his true strength when they had crossed paths at the Taowu Mountain Range. If this man had the power to enter the Door of Darkness, he was probably a pinnacle Immortal Step realm expert.

However, the power that he had unleashed... He could tell from the barely detectable energy waves that this fatty gave off the aura of a Saint.

Chapter 760:


Chapter 778 - Escape of the Quasi-Emperor


Without noticing the shock of the two people beside him, Sheng Yan exerted his cultivation completely and undisguisedly. His entire being seemed to become a ball of green flame which could not burn any more brilliantly, displaying the full extent of his powers. He clutched the craggy licorice gourd with both of his hands and berserkly injected his yuan qi into it.

Under his inducement, blood-colored veins that resembled slightly-constricted human blood vessels appeared on the surface of the gourd, on which the original deformities were instantly repaired and a metallic luster began to shine, bursting forth with an extremely dazzling blood-colored splendor.

Blood qi surged as the splendor circulated.

As a result of Sheng Yan's relentless inducement, the heavily-cracked gourd discharged an immense power which even contained a tinge of magical force.

This gourd was indeed a rare divine object.

Ye Qingyu was not quite shocked by this.

In fact, many people had already predicted that this would happen.

Sheng Yan continued to chant the mystical ancient battle song before raising the gourd with both hands. As if pouring all of his strength into it, he smashed it heavily toward the spot on the temple wall which the blood-colored beam pointed at.

Bam!

Baboom!

Two blares followed in succession.

The divine temple began to vibrate.

Ye Qingyu's sight became fixed.

Did it... really work?

Standing to one side, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden also revealed a nervous look as she held her breath.

However, the tremor soon died down, and despite its occurrence, the weakest spot on the mottled and ancient wall where the sword mark was showed no trace of crack.

Ye Qingyu frowned slightly.

This won't do!

It didn't get smashed open.

Even the licorice gourd, which contained the magical ability and battle power of a past Quasi-emperor, failed to break apart the crack. How exactly did this divine temple come about, and what power are its walls hiding?

Countless ideas flashed through his mind.

Sheng Yan, who had begun gasping for breath after exerting his full power, looked in disbelief. After catching the falling gourd in his hands, he roared once more and exerted yet another powerful smash at the temple wall.

Boom!

Another loud blare rang out.

The divine temple shook and emitted a low and strange buzzing noise that sounded like a giant bell gently knocked on by a clapper. The movements this time were greater than those of the previous time, but the weakest spot on the wall still did not show even a hairline crack.

Failed again!

Boom boom boom!

Looking mad, Sheng Yan not only did not give up but readily burned up his foundation and opened his mouth to spew streams of blood essence onto the gourd. In doing so, he was using his origin power to inject even more power into the gourd which he smashed at the wall over and over.

As if it was a living thing, the licorice gourd absorbed his essence and blood and thereafter its blood-colored splendor became more distinct. Multiple veins broke out on it as it struck heavily on the divine temple, which shook endlessly while the chaotic mist in the surroundings began to churn like waves.

The buzzing noise became deafening.

It sounded like it was from the ancient Fiendgod Age, condemning and cursing Sheng Yan's evil actions.

Unfortunately, his maniacal behavior had no effect still.

"Sheng Yan..." Speaking hesitantly, Ye Qingyu wanted to advise him.

Just then, the [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei's] voice was once again heard in the divine temple.

"Little Yan... you'd better leave... this temple is where Fiendgods were imprisoned when the chaos first started... The [Great Void Gourd] has been damaged and has lost its former power, and thereby cannot smash the crack open..."

The ancient dreamlike voice contained boundless vicissitudes and seemed to reveal a desolation which had sunk in over thousands of years.

Hearing this, Sheng Yan began to look despondent.

Tears once again crawled all over his plump face.

He frenziedly charged toward the divine temple and violently struck at its walls, crying in a rueful and wailing voice, "Ancestor, don't try to advise me... I'm not leaving, not after I've sacrificed so much and gone through so many difficulties to get so far... the descendants of our race have ran into mishap, leaving only me alive... Even if I were to go, I'd be alone... So I would rather... be buried here with you!"

Seeing and hearing the words of the sad and despondent man, Ye Qingyu was surprised to learn that the latter was only the remaining descendant of the Quasi-emperor, and felt an unbearable sympathy in his heart at once.

When he walked up to the wall, he clenched his fist, causing the pure and frisky bright yellow Immortal qi to condense in his hands immediately.

In the next moment.

He slammed a palm forth.

The palm force of Immortal qi unleashed tremendous power and shot like a laser arrow toward the weakest spot on the wall.

Boom!

Another huge blare was heard.

This time, the blare was even more heart-palpitating than the earlier sounds, while the accompanying movements was no less than caused by the [Great Void Gourd].

Sheng Yan was shocked.

While each standing on different sides, the trio simultaneously focused their sights on the weakest spot on the wall.

However...

Not even the faintest of marks?

This time, Ye Qingyu, too, revealed a disbelieving look.

Despair conspicuously flashed across Sheng Yan's eyes.

Then, he looked at Ye Qingyu and said in a choked voice, "Thank you so much, Brother. You two should get going. If you stay any longer, you might lose any chance of escaping..."

Ye Qingyu did not say anything.

Despite the danger of the situation, the person trapped in the divine temple was [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] after all. He was the hope and future of the Human Race, and even in the short term, the benefits of saving him would be that the humans can finally hold their heads high again. With a leader, they could become united once more, so much so that they would awe those overweeningly ambitious foreign races.

Furthermore, the Heaven Wasteland Domain would not have to strive so painstakingly.

The benefits of forming an affinity with a Quasi-emperor were endless. Even if the domain failed the test ultimately, who would dare to colonize it with [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] around?

Therefore, this still had to be tried.

I have to give it a shot.

Seeing the resolute expression on Ye Qingyu's face, a strange color flashed across the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's eye. Without speaking, she slowly walked forward.

Although there was no obvious magical ability or aura surging about her, the wisp of rainbow-colored flowing light that arose from her palm flickered an extremely dazzling radiance which revealed extremely pure world spiritual qi and divine power.

Under her incitement, the flowing light condensed into a rainbow-colored arrow that shot toward the wall.

Boom!

Yet another blare.

The divine temple shook.

However, it was all in vain.

The spot struck by the light arrow remained markless.

A hint of shock flashed across the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's eyes.

Her rainbow-colored arrow and Ye Qingyu's bright yellow Immortal qi were not too different in power and neither could make a qualitative breakthrough. The sturdiness of the divine temple had absolutely exceeded what they believed possible.

"How about trying to burn it with fire?"

There was a sparkle in Ye Qingyu's eyes as if he had thought of something.

The [Red Lotus Hellfire], which can burn even a fiendgod, might be useful here.

The Celestial Phoenix Maiden nodded faintly when she heard this.

[Red Lotus Hellfire] spurted from a small opening in her cherry lips.

The blood-colored fire shot like an arrow directly at the weakest spot on the wall.

After burning for several dozen breaths' worth of time.

The Celestial Phoenix Maiden only then gradually kept her flames back.

However, the trio was left disappointed once more. There was not a mark left on the wall and not even a sign that the copper had caught fire.

How is this divine temple able to withstand the demonic flames of the fiendgods?

No wonder it has been able to trap someone like [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] for so many years.

The murderous spirit in the surroundings became more distinct than before, as if everything was being destroyed and every living creature was being strangled to death. A strange hissing noise could even be vaguely heard from the distance, sounding as frightening as the arrival of evil demons in the human world.

He could not help feeling anxious.

Subsequently.

The trio kept on trying all sorts of methods.

Ye Qingyu successively took out the [Dragonblood halberd] and the [Blood Drinker Sword] to chop and hack, and then tried all of his other weapons.

Nothing worked.

Not half a trace was left.

Under the stimulus of his bright yellow Immortal qi, all of his weapons became shockingly powerful, yet they could barely even shake the divine temple.

Time ticked by.

The trio became extremely anxious and their expressions became grimmer as time passed.

What can be done?

The primeval force in the world had already begun to tumble maniacally like boiling water.

The range of lofty mountains was caving in, while the waterfalls and rivers were turning into nothingness.

Fierce murderous spirit raged all around and suffused toward them endlessly.

It became unclear whether they could escape in time.

The situation grew more critical.

As the only Quasi-emperor of the Human Race for several thousand years, Xiaofei had long been deeply revered by Ye Qingyu, who was afraid that if the former remained trapped in the divine temple, his lifespan would be depleted by the next, only-god-knows-when, opening of the Doors of Life, and he would thus never get out of here.

Ye Qingyu also contemplated whether to leave behind the fatty who cried about wanting to be buried together with Xiaofei.

"Have to give
it
a try."

In this desperate moment, Ye Qingyu took the [Cloud Top Cauldron] out of his arms.

Without saying another word, he operated his true vitality before smashing the cauldron forcefully at the sword mark on the divine temple.

Ding!

An extremely crisp sound was heard.

Shortly after, the divine temple shook wildly like never before, as apocalyptic bouts of murderous spirit spurted from the divine temple and pervaded the surroundings.

Six eye beams looked attentively in unison at the copper wall.

A fine crack appeared at the spot where the blood-colored laser beam pointed.

Something finally works!

The trio became excited and their hopes were rekindled.

All the more ecstatic, Sheng Yan fixed his feverishly-shining eyes on Ye Qingyu and shouted, "Brother, go, quick..."

He was simply so excited that his entire body was trembling.

Ye Qingyu was delighted.

He chided himself for being stupid enough not to think about using the [Cloud Top Cauldron] early on. Then, he injected the bright yellow Immortal qi in his hands directly into the cauldron and hurled the cauldron again.

Ding!

Another crisp sound was heard.

The divine temple incessantly set off a buzzing noise which caused one to shudder.

Under the feverish gazes of three pairs of eyes, a hairline crack broke open at the weakest spot along the deepest sword mark on the grey copper wall.

Virtually at the same time, the Quasi-emperor blood in the gourd burst forth a splendor and seemed to come alive as it zipped like lightning into the crack.

The next flash of a moment.

A pale green splendor spurted from the crack.

"Ancestor!" Sheng Yan cried joyously as he knelt in respect.

The pale green splendor gradually transformed into an emaciated old man.
